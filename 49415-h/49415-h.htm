<p class="introd noindent">In presenting to American youth this
carefully-edited volume of home
amusements, the publishers are
happy in their belief that in the
selection and treatment of the subjects
chosen the Editor and the
accomplished experts who have
contributed to its pages have successfully
combined, to a degree not
commonly found in books prepared
for the young, much sound scientific
instruction and a large amount
of that recreative amusement that
seldom fails to awaken an interest
both in the youthful mind and in
the minds of &#8220;children of a larger
growth.&#8221; In the language of the
accomplished Editor, as expressed
in his prefatory note to the English edition, the volume is &#8220;a veritable<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
recreative text-book, prepared by experts in their several subjects, and
treated with sufficient amplitude of detail and thoroughness of exposition
to render their respective contributions of very real and permanent educational
value. Mere &#8216;rule of thumb&#8217; is scrupulously avoided, and underlying
<i>principles</i> are clearly and intelligently explained. The tyro is led on
pleasantly step by step, and almost unconsciously learns many lessons
that should stand him in good stead in the battle of life. The wealth
of graphic illustrations&mdash;of clever pictures that really illustrate&mdash;is another
and not, we think, the least noteworthy feature of the book.</p>

<p class="introd">&#8220;In the numerous and greatly diversified sections, it will be seen, the
work is carefully graduated in the natural order&mdash;from the simpler to
the more complex and difficult tasks. We have also endeavoured wherever
practicable&mdash;as in the model-making chapters&mdash;to afford, by means of
alternative plans, instructions likely to cause little or no tax upon the
pocket, as well as some that necessarily involve more or less expenditure
for tools and material. Thus, boys of all ages and conditions&mdash;at home or
at school; with leisure and ample opportunities, or already closely engaged
in the sterner duties of bread-winning; boys to whom a considerable
preliminary outlay may be of trifling moment, and others who rarely have
a shilling to spare,&mdash;may alike turn to the different chapters with the
certainty of finding something for each, calculated to afford both pleasure
and profit in those spare hours that are the gold-dust of time.</p>

<p class="introd">&#8220;It will be pretty generally admitted, we presume, that a pronounced
characteristic of the age is the daily increasing attention given to Athletics
and Technical Training.... This book seeks to give that class of instruction
in the most attractive guise. The subjects in which boys naturally feel
peculiar interest are skilfully treated by writers of proved capacity and aptitude
for the task; and hence considerable space is devoted to those essentially
boys&#8217; topics that are not only of recreative value in themselves, but<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
incidentally afford invaluable training to eye and hand.... Nor is the moral
and spiritual side of boy-nature overlooked. Games dominated by elements
of &#8216;chance&#8217; or &#8216;luck,&#8217; as well as those of questionable or evil associations,
are of course scrupulously ignored. But this negative claim to confidence is
also supplemented by the positive influence exerted towards the building
up of a true, robust Christian manhood. It were indeed a grievous thing
if, while learning from this book how to use wisely many of the ingenious
tools and contrivances described, any boy should neglect to learn how to
control and direct to the most useful work in the service of God and of
man the marvellous and complex machinery of his own moral and spiritual
nature. To every reader, therefore, we make bold to speak that direct,
manly word, that no true-hearted boy will resent. It is Dr. Cuyler, if
we mistake not, who remarks that Samson builded better than he knew
when he uttered his famous riddle, &#8216;Out of the eater came forth meat, and
out of the strong came forth sweetness;&#8217; for the pathway of life has many
a lion in it, and our success and happiness depend not a little on the way
we meet the foe. Thus Hedley Vicars encountered quite a shower of scoffs
from his brother officers in the Crimean army when he was first converted.
But he put his Bible on his table in his tent, and stood by his colours.
Henceforth the lion was not only slain, but there was rich honey in the
carcase when his religious influence became a power in his regiment. In
the carcase of a slain temptation, also, millions besides Joseph have found
delicious honey. &#8216;There is not a peril, or a trouble, or a spiritual foe of
any kind but may be vanquished by the help of Samson&#8217;s God. Life&#8217;s
sweetest enjoyments are gathered from the <i>victories of faith</i>. Out of
slain lions come forth meat; out of conquered foes to the soul come its
sweetest honeycombs. One of the joys of heaven will be the remembrance
of victories won during our earthly conflicts.&#8217; In Christ&#8217;s name
and power, try it, boys!&#8221;</p>

<p class="introd">This volume will be followed by another, prepared on similar principles,
devoted to <i>outdoor</i> sports and recreations; and the two, it is believed, will
form a very complete encyclop&aelig;dia of amusements adapted to the youth
of all ages and circumstances.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.&mdash;GYMNASTICS.<br />
<span class="smcap">By a Member of the London Athletic Club.</span></h3>

<h4>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Preliminary Hints as to Dress, Diet, and Exercises without
Apparatus.</span></h4>

<p class="chapstart">That fine old Latin motto, &#8216;Mens sana in corpore sano&#8217; (&#8216;A vigorous mind
in a sound body&#8217;), has stood the test of years, and happily its truth is day by
day more forcibly asserting itself. The feeling is becoming general that body
and mind ought to be developed to the utmost, for they are both gifts to us,
divinely bestowed, and for the proper use of them we are responsible.</p>

<p>The benefits of <i>judicious</i> exercise to the human frame cannot be over-estimated.
In these days of sedentary occupations, it becomes an absolute necessity, an
antidote, in fact, to the labours of the brain. By its use the balance between
mind and body is preserved.</p>

<p>Irrespective of the increased health that gymnastics impart, and the spring
which they give to the mind, they possess one great advantage, namely, that
they endow the gymnast with presence of mind in difficulties. In positions of
danger how much better chance of escape those who have trained themselves to
use their limbs will have over those who have not!</p>

<p>Foremost as we stand among nations, it is surprising that such indifference
should have hitherto prevailed with regard to the development of the body. In
many continental countries (Germany and Switzerland more especially) gymnastics
form part of a boy&#8217;s education; here, at any rate until quite recently, they were
indulged in only as an accessory, and often without the aid and direction of an
experienced teacher. Boys are allowed to enter the gymnasium, make their own
choice of apparatus (and they generally select that which requires the greatest skill),
and, in imitation of some expert gymnast whose performances they have witnessed,
attempt feats far beyond their strength, which can only be successfully accomplished
after a systematic course of practice. The result is often positive injury, and
<i>always</i> discouragement.</p>

<p>As in other things, there is no royal road to gymnastics. The learner must
begin with simple and gentle exercises if he wishes to acquire a graceful and easy
style, increasing them in difficulty in regular degree, according to his strength
and progress. The extra time and trouble devoted to the simple exercises, in
which lies the groundwork of the most &#8216;taking&#8217; feats, will be acknowledged
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
have been well expended, and the acquirement of a cool, easy, and elegant style
will prove sufficient recompense for having assiduously practised them.</p>

<p>The best material for dress is undoubtedly white flannel. A pair of trousers made
to fit the legs tolerably closely, with plenty of room in the seat (not &#8216;baggy,&#8217; of
course), a close-fitting ordinary under jersey, minus the sleeves (to give freedom
to the arms), and a pair of canvas shoes without heels, are all that are necessary
for wear during actual practice. Add to these a loose jacket of medium thickness
to slip on during intervals of rest, and you have your costume complete.</p>

<p>Upon the question of wearing a belt opinions are divided. Many gymnasts
approve of it, and assert that it affords them support; but our view, in which we
are confirmed by medical authority, is that artificial support should be avoided.
All that is necessary is that the trousers should be made to fit well over the hips,
with a waistband about 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. in width, and a strap and buckle behind. Be
sure that the flannel is <i>well shrunk</i> (by immersion in water for about thirty-six
hours) previous to making up.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to describe the exercises, we have a word to say with regard
to the time at which they can be most beneficially practised. Let it be a golden
rule never to attempt work directly after a meal. The digestive organs require
time to fulfil their functions, and exercise upon a full stomach only impairs and
weakens them. Food should not be taken immediately <i>after</i> practice; a short
time&mdash;say half an hour&mdash;should elapse before eating.</p>

<p>It is of importance that these directions should be observed, for with impaired
digestion the muscles, instead of being strengthened and developed by exercise,
are really weakened and reduced, in consequence of not having received the
nourishment which digestion alone can extract from food.</p>

<p>Light practice before breakfast may be taken with advantage, but a dry biscuit
or crust of bread should be eaten on rising.</p>

<h4>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Exercises without Apparatus.</span></h4>

<p><i>No.</i> 1. Place the heels together, toes pointing outwards, stand perfectly upright,
as at attention, chest expanded. Raise the arms, and stretch them out in front,
hands open, palms touching. Keeping the hands at the same level, throw them
as far behind the back as you can. Do not bend the body. Continue this
exercise until you feel you have had enough.</p>

<p><i>No.</i> 2. Stand as before. Clench the hands and throw them out in front.
Bring them back sharply to the sides, throw them out again, and continue.</p>

<p><i>No.</i> 3. Again same position. Raise the fists to the shoulders, knuckles
turned outwards, strike upwards. Bring the fists down again to the shoulders.</p>

<p><i>No.</i> 4. Extend the arms at full length on each side, hands open, palms
upwards. Bend from the elbow, bringing the tips of the fingers to the shoulders,
then straighten out again. This is fine exercise for the biceps.</p>

<p>Now combine these four exercises, doing them in succession.</p>

<p><i>No.</i> 5. Stand with the legs a little apart, toes pointing outwards. Arms
straight, and hanging in front. Describe a circle in front of you with each hand,
alternately keeping the fist shut and arms <i>perfectly straight</i>. First one way, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
hands going outwards, then the other coming inwards. Keep up this &#8216;windmill&#8217;
action for some time.</p>

<p>These extension exercises will give ease and pliancy to the arms and their
joints.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Leg Movements.</span></h5>

<p><i>No.</i> 1. Place the hands on the hips, and stand upright, heels together. Raise
each leg alternatively, as high as possible, straight out in front of you, toes pointed,
leg perfectly still.</p>

<p>This should not be done too slowly, but with a slight swing, as in the act
of kicking.</p>

<p><i>No.</i> 2. In addition to the forward movement, swing the leg behind you, do not
bend the body over, and mind your balance. Keep up this pendulum movement,
first with one leg, then with the other, counting 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, leg out in front; 2,
swing behind; 3, in front again; 4, foot to ground to first position; then do the
same with the other leg.</p>

<p><i>No.</i> 3. Stand as in No. 1, and throw each knee up alternately, endeavouring to
strike the chest. Do not stoop forward. This exercise loosens the knee joints.</p>

<p><i>No.</i> 4. When in the position described last, with the knee raised, throw the
leg out in front, and straighten it before bringing the foot to the ground. This is
part of No. 1.</p>

<p><i>No.</i> 5. Stand as before. Now sink down slowly, as low as possible, raising the
heels from the ground, knees bent at an angle, then rise again. Do this at least
twenty times in succession. It will give it to you in the calves and thighs, but it is
splendid exercise.</p>

<p>If you practise these exercises for about half an hour every day for a week
you will be ready for the more advanced practice which we shall next describe.</p>

<h4>III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Exercises with Apparatus.</span></h4>

<p>The exercises described in the last section do not by any means exhaust the
list of extension movements that can be practised. They are sufficient, however,
to form a groundwork upon which the reader may begin. Many other exercises
will readily suggest themselves to him during practice.</p>

<p>If he has a few friends who will join him in them, it will prove mutually
advantageous, the exercises becoming much less monotonous by being performed
in company. One should act as director, standing facing the others, and setting
the exercises, counting aloud 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.</p>

<p>This system is practised at all the large gymnasiums, the &#8216;Mass Exercise,&#8217; as
it is called, commencing the evening&#8217;s work, and forming a very pretty spectacle.
This is notably the case at the German Gymnasium, King&#8217;s Cross, where
frequently as many as 200 gymnasts, standing at arm&#8217;s length from each other
and obedient to the word of command from the leader, who occupies a raised
platform in front of them, go through the extensions in unison and perfect time.
The effect is unique, and must be seen to be appreciated.</p>

<p>After having become accustomed to these movements, they may be practised
with light dumb-bells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The pupil having passed through the preliminaries, and moulded himself a
little into shape, we now proceed to describe the exercises <i>with</i> apparatus. Those
on the &#8216;horizontal bar&#8217; being among the most strengthening of gymnastic
performances, and perhaps also the most varied and attractive, we shall treat
of them first.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Horizontal Bar.</span></h5>

<p>Almost every boy is familiar with this apparatus, but for the benefit of the few
who may be in ignorance,
we give a drawing
of it (<a href="#FigI01">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI01">
<img src="images/illo022a.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="500" height="323" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The bar or pole
should be of ash, diameter
2 inches, length
6 feet. The more expensive
bars have a
steel core running
through the middle,
in which case the diameter
can be reduced
to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches, and the
length increased to 7
feet. This size is decidedly
more pleasant
for use, as a firmer grip
can be obtained than
on the thicker bars.
The height of the bar
from the ground of
course varies according
to that of the gymnast,
who should be able to
touch the lower side
with <i>both</i> hands (the
tips of the fingers)
when standing raised
on his toes. When
<i>hanging</i> by the hands,
the toes will then just
clear the ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI02">
<img src="images/illo022b.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="500" height="314" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Having adjusted the
apparatus to the proper
height, begin by</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hanging on the Bar and the Walk.</span></h5>

<p>Jump up and seize the bar with both hands, knuckles upwards, the thumbs on
<i>the same side as the fingers</i>. Remember (with the exceptions mentioned later
on)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
never to grasp the bar as you would a broomstick, but hook the hand over it. Let
the legs hang perfectly straight and together, toes pointed.</p>

<p>Now &#8216;walk&#8217; with the hands from one end of the bar to the other, and back
again. Keep the body steady and avoid swaying (<a href="#FigI02">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Breasting the Bar.</span></h5>

<p>Hang on the bar as before, and slowly draw yourself up, keeping the shoulders
square, until the chest is level with the bar (<a href="#FigI03">Fig. 3</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI03">
<img src="images/illo023a.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="250" height="420" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Then lower the body until the arms are quite straight again, draw up again, and
continue to practise until you can accomplish it from eight to a dozen times in
succession. When breasting the bar, repeat the walk in that position.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI04">
<img src="images/illo023b.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="550" height="163" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Now try swinging forward and backward, arms straight, increasing the height
with each swing until the body assumes an almost horizontal position. When at
the extent of the backward swing, the hands should be shifted slightly round the
bar to recover the grip which the forward swing has lessened (<a href="#FigI04">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI04A">
<img src="images/illo023c.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="400" height="219" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4A.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Now in the backward swing release your hold of the bar and launch yourself
away from it with a slight push and alight on your feet. This will accustom you to
leaving the bar neatly and effectively (<a href="#FigI04A">Fig. 4A</a>).</p>

<h5 id="Ref02"><span class="smcap">The Short Circle.</span></h5>

<p>Draw the chest up to the bar, throw the head well back, raising the legs at the
same time (keep them straight), and get the toes over the front of the bar, pulling
hard with the arms (<a href="#FigI05">Fig. 5</a>). This will cause you to revolve half round the bar,
and will bring you into position as in <a href="#FigI06">Fig. 6</a>.</p>

<div class="figc450">

<div class="figleft" id="FigI05">
<img src="images/illo024a.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="236" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="figright" id="FigI06">
<img src="images/illo024b.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="177" height="350" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span></p>
</div>

</div><!--figc450-->

<p>This is rather difficult to perform, and requires a deal of practice, but it is an
indispensable exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>When in this position (<a href="#FigI06">Fig. 6</a>) endeavour to revolve completely round the bar
like a wheel on its axis. To do this you must throw the upper part of the body
forward with a good swing, at the same time keeping the arms rigid, and giving
yourself sufficient impetus to go round, coming up into the original position.</p>

<h5 id="Ref01"><span class="smcap">Getting on to the Bar.</span></h5>

<p>Get into position as in <a href="#FigI03">Fig. 3</a>, then drop the right side of the body, simultaneously
throwing the left leg over the bar as in <a href="#FigI07">Fig. 7</a>, and swing the other leg
which will have the effect of bringing you up over the bar. Endeavour to come up
with the body upright, as in <a href="#FigI08">Fig. 8</a>.</p>

<div class="figc620">

<div class="figleft" id="FigI07">
<img src="images/illo024c.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="355" height="325" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7</p>
</div>

<div class="figright" id="FigI08">
<img src="images/illo024d.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="225" height="325" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 8</p>
</div>

</div><!--figc600-->

<p>You will experience some difficulty in doing this, and your first attempt will
no doubt result in a mere scramble up, but persevere until success rewards your
efforts.</p>

<p>There is another method you may try&mdash;viz., to bring the leg up through the
hands, and, with a good swing, bring yourself up, as in <a href="#FigI08">Fig. 8</a>.</p>

<p>One method is perhaps as good as the other, but neither can be neatly
performed without continual practice.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Leg Swing (Backwards).</span></h5>

<p>When in position, as in <a href="#FigI08">Fig. 8</a>, swing the right leg out behind, at the same
time shifting the left leg backward until the bend of the knee catches the bar
(<a href="#FigI09">Fig. 9</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI09">
<img src="images/illo025a.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="225" height="326" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 9</p>
</div>

<p>Keep the arms straight, and throw the head back with a good swing, just
enough to bring you round the bar into the original position. You must be
careful in judging the swing, otherwise you will find that you cannot stop yourself,
and will make a half turn too much. After a little practice you will be able to
judge the first swing to a nicety, and come up with a good balance. Now do
several turns without stopping, always remembering to finish above the bar.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI10">
<img src="images/illo025b.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="200" height="356" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 10</p>
</div>

<p>For the forward leg swing, turn the hands the other way, leaning the weight
of the body on the arms; throw the head forward, and, with one bold
plunge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
keeping the body erect, and holding tightly on to the bar, make the revolution
(<a href="#FigI10">Fig. 10</a>).</p>

<p>Do not be content with accomplishing this with one leg only, but practise with
right and left alternately.</p>

<p>The forward swing will tax your confidence more than the backward, but it is
really not more difficult. You will, after a little practice, be able to make several
revolutions in succession. This has a very dashing appearance.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">To Sit on the Bar.</span></h5>

<p>This will prove rather difficult at first. Get on to the bar, as in <a href="#FigI08">Fig. 8</a>, and
preserving your balance, bring the hanging leg with a rapid movement over the
bar into a sitting position. To effect this you must leave go of the bar with the
right hand, resuming your grasp directly the leg has passed under your hand. You
will now be in position as in <a href="#FigI11">Fig. 11</a>.</p>

<div class="figc425">

<div class="figleft" id="FigI11">
<img src="images/illo025c.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="175" height="325" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 11</p>
</div>

<div class="figright" id="FigI12">
<img src="images/illo025d.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="217" height="325" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 12</p>
</div>

</div><!--figc425-->

<p>This exercise really consists of balancing, and in your first attempts you will
find a tendency to roll over backwards directly the leg reaches the level of
the bar. Should you do so, however, you can quickly recover your position
by the method described in &#8216;<a href="#Ref01">getting on to the bar</a>.&#8217;</p>

<div class="figc550">

<div class="figleft" id="FigI13">
<img src="images/illo025e.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="250" height="325" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 13</p>
</div>

<div class="figright" id="FigI14">
<img src="images/illo025f.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="260" height="325" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 14</p>
</div>

</div><!--figc550-->

<p>There is another way of getting into the sitting position. Hang on as in
<a href="#FigI02">Fig. 2</a>, and doubling up, pass the legs through the arms (<a href="#FigI14">Fig. 14</a>), straighten
the body, as in <a href="#FigI15">Fig. 15</a>, and draw yourself up until the posterior is a little
above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the bar. You will then, with a slight bend of the body, roll over into position.
You must keep the head well back, and pull hard with the arms.</p>

<div class="figc400">

<div class="figleft" id="FigI15">
<img src="images/illo026a.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="176" height="350" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 15</p>
</div>

<div class="figright" id="FigI16">
<img src="images/illo026b.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="191" height="350" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 16</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>A good exercise for the muscles of the back is to drop through when in
position as in <a href="#FigI14">Fig. 14</a>, to position as in <a href="#FigI16">Fig. 16</a>, and back again to
<a href="#FigI02">Fig. 2</a>. Be
careful to keep the legs <i>straight</i> while doing it. It is easy enough to effect
with legs bent.</p>

<p>Having accomplished &#8216;sitting,&#8217; accustom yourself to remaining in that position
without holding the bar with the hands, balancing yourself with the bar under
different parts of the leg.</p>

<p>This will prepare you for the</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Sit Swing (Backward)</span>,</h5>

<p class="noindent">which is not unlike the leg swing, but very much more difficult, as greater
strength is required, in consequence of the whole weight being thrown upon
the arms.</p>

<p>Sitting on the bar as in <a href="#FigI11">Fig. 11</a>, stiffen the arms, and launch yourself backwards
with a good swing, holding the bar firmly with both hands, and go right round
the bar with the impetus you have given yourself, resuming the position from which
you started. As in the leg swing, you must judge the swing correctly, or else you
will go round half a turn too much, or fail to give sufficient swing to come up at all.
This will very likely be the case in your first few attempts, for you can hardly
expect to accomplish the feat at once.</p>

<p>In attempting this exercise it is as well to have some one standing in front of
the bar ready to catch you in the event of your not having given swing enough to
balance yourself, in which case you will fall forward.</p>

<p>In the sit swing forward, starting is the important part. Raise the body as far
from the bar as possible, the whole weight supported on the arms (<a href="#FigI12">Fig. 12</a>), legs
straight, chest thrown out. Now with a bold plunge forward you will go right
round (that is after a time). The arms must be kept perfectly straight, as in
<a href="#FigI13">Fig. 13</a>, and the hands of course reversed as in the leg swing forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>This feat requires more nerve than any we have yet described, and, as a natural
accompaniment, more practice, but it will well repay any amount of perseverance.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hanging by the Legs.</span></h5>

<p>Sit on the bar, then suddenly slide backwards and drop, catching yourself by
your bent knees (<a href="#FigI17">Fig. 17</a>).</p>

<div class="figc600">

</div>

</div><!--figc600-->

<p>You must be very careful not to communicate any swing to the body, but to
drop quite straight, or off you will come. Having successfully acquired this exercise,
you may now practise swinging by the legs, when as in <a href="#FigI18">Fig. 18</a>, let go with your
legs, and let them drop and come on your feet on the ground. This exercise had
better be first practised on a bar sufficiently low to allow of your just touching with
the tips of your fingers when hanging, in case you hold on too long, and so come
on your hands and feet instead of on your feet only. A very little practice, however,
will suffice to give you the knack of leaving go at the exact moment, and as this
method of leaving the bar is often called into requisition at the end of a series of
combined movements, it should be acquired perfectly.</p>

<p>We cannot too strongly advise our young friends who wish to become gymnasts
to pay particular attention to the <i>style</i> in which they perform the exercises. Many a
difficult feat is spoiled in appearance by the clumsy manner in which it is executed,
and fails to elicit the admiration afforded to a much simpler movement gracefully
performed.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Clear Circle.</span></h5>

<p>This exercise is very difficult, and will necessitate a lot of practice. It differs
from the &#8216;<a href="#Ref02">Short Circle</a>&#8217; already described in this important particular, viz., that
the circle is performed without any part of the body touching the bar. You
must commence by drawing the chest up to the bar from the hanging position,
then throw the head back, and, raising the legs, and pulling hard with the arms,
endeavour to bring the feet over the bar, describing, as it were, part of a circle.
While the legs are passing round, straighten the arms, and you will come into
position as in <a href="#FigI19">Fig. 19</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI19">
<img src="images/illo027b.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="277" height="325" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 19</p>
</div>

<p>Now revolve round the bar, keeping the arms rigid, and the body away from
the bar. The whole weight of the body (which must be kept quite straight) will
thus be thrown on the arms. Our readers must not be discouraged at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
nonsuccess that will attend their first efforts to accomplish this exercise, which,
as we have before remarked, is a very difficult one, and requires a deal of practice
before the knack can be acquired.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Muscle Grind.</span></h5>

<p>This, although not difficult to perform, is very showy, and frequently elicits
greater applause from an audience than much more difficult feats. Get on to the bar
in sitting position, as in <a href="#FigI11">Fig. 11</a>, then slide down in front, at the same time putting
the arms straight down behind you until the bar comes across the biceps; then
communicate a swing to the body until you have acquired sufficient momentum
to carry you completely round the bar. The ordinary way in which this feat is
performed is with the head going forwards (<a href="#FigI20">Fig. 20</a>). The other way (backwards) is
more difficult.</p>

<div class="figc585">

<div class="figleft" id="FigI20">
<img src="images/illo028a.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="281" height="335" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 20</p>
</div>

<div class="figright" id="FigI21">
<img src="images/illo028b.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="272" height="335" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 21</p>
</div>

</div><!--figc585-->

<p>It can be done in a third way, with the arms straight along the bar (<a href="#FigI21">Fig. 21</a>).</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hanging by the Toes.</span></h5>

<p>This is easier than most people imagine. Whatever difficulty may be found
will consist not so much in the actual sustaining of the weight of the body by the
toes as in the task of getting the feet into position on the bar. We will suppose,
however, that by this time the pupil will have mastered the <a href="#Ref02">short circle</a> described
on <a href="#Page_23">page 23</a>, in which case he will find it easy enough to hitch the toes on the bar
instead of bringing them over to complete the circle. This having been accomplished,
nothing remains but to leave go with the hands and let the body drop
slowly until hanging quite perpendicularly (<a href="#FigI22">Fig. 22</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI22">
<img src="images/illo028c.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="180" height="350" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 22</p>
</div>

<p>In first attempting this, it is advisable to stretch out your arms, so as to be
prepared in case you find your feet slipping off. To drop on to the hands is the
easier way of leaving the bar from this position, but it is not the correct one, which
is to draw the body up and resume your hold of the bar by the hands.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Hock Swing.</span></h5>

<p>This is like the sit &#8216;swing backward,&#8217; except that it is performed without
holding the bar by the hands, which of course renders it very much more difficult.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Sit on the bar as far back as possible, and then launch yourself backwards with
arms extended, holding tight with the legs, and, with a good swing, come right
round the bar into sitting position from which you started (<a href="#FigI23">Fig. 23</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI23">
<img src="images/illo029a.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="228" height="325" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 23</p>
</div>

<p>Great demand will be made upon your store of confidence in the performance
of this feat, but it well repays the practice involved, as it has a very dashing
appearance, especially when several turns are done in succession, which you will be
able to accomplish after a time.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Upstart.</span></h5>

<p>This is an indispensable exercise, and one that will be frequently called into
requisition by the gymnast as he becomes more advanced. It consists of getting
on to the bar by a swing and a jerk, the peculiar nature of which it is rather
difficult to describe. First hang by the hands, then bring the feet up to the bar
and shoot them out sharply as far as possible (<a href="#FigI24">Fig. 24</a>), at the same time pulling
hard with the arms.</p>

<p>You will find, after a time, that this will have the effect of bringing you right up
on to the bar as in <a href="#FigI06">Fig. 6</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI24">
<img src="images/illo029b.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="284" height="300" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 24</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI25">
<img src="images/illo029c.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="379" height="300" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 25</p>
</div>

<p>The upstart can be performed without the swing, but the arms in this case must
be kept perfectly straight. Raise the legs as before, then drop them suddenly and
pull the body above the bar. To see the upstart once performed will do more
towards teaching its acquirement than pages of explanation. It is purely a
knack, which will come to you all at once, after, perhaps, numberless fruitless
attempts (<a href="#FigI25">Fig. 25</a>).</p>

<h5 id="Ref04"><span class="smcap">The Slow Pull-up</span></h5>

<p class="noindent">is another method of getting on to the bar, and is a feat of strength rather than of
agility, great muscular power being necessary for its successful accomplishment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI26">
<img src="images/illo029d.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="200" height="350" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 26</p>
</div>

<p>It is performed by drawing the body up while hanging from the bar. The
hands must be well over the bar&mdash;in fact, the wrists must rest there. In this
exercise it is better to have the thumbs underneath (this is one of the exceptions
referred to in <a href="#Page_22">page 22</a>), as otherwise, when you come up, your hands may slip off.
<a href="#FigI26">Fig. 26</a> shows the position midway.</p>

<p>This is the critical point, and all your strength will be required to get the rest
of the way. By raising the elbows a little you will find you will get a greater
purchase, and the raising of the legs will counterbalance the weight of the body
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
bring it up. This exercise always meets with great applause, especially when done
several times in succession, a feat that will task your powers to their utmost.</p>

<p>Another strength movement is the</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Horizontal (Back and Front)</span>.</h5>

<p>It consists of supporting the body by the strength of the arms, as shown in
<a href="#FigI27">Figs. 27</a>, <a href="#FigI28">28</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI27">
<img src="images/illo030a.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="352" height="150" />

</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI28">
<img src="images/illo030b.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="386" height="150" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 28</p>
</div>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Splits.</span></h5>

<p>This must first be practised on a bar reaching not higher than the waist. The
feat is to clear the bar as shown in <a href="#FigI29">Fig. 29</a>. Some amount of confidence will be
required for the performance of this exercise, and there must be no hesitation in the
matter, or over you will come on your nose. First practise jumping on to the bar,
so as to touch with both feet <i>inside</i> the hands; then try outside, and, when you
have become accustomed to this movement, you may make your attempt to go
clean over. You must be careful to let go with the hands at the proper moment
when in position shown in <a href="#FigI29">Fig. 29</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI29">
<img src="images/illo030c.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="300" height="235" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 29</p>
</div>

<p>The exercise is usually first acquired on the &#8216;<a href="#Ref03">horse</a>&#8217; (an apparatus which we shall
describe in due course), and is much more difficult on the horizontal bar, but as it is
a very pretty finish to a series of combined movements, we have introduced it here.</p>

<p>We should recommend your having some one standing in front of the bar when
you commence to practise this movement, to catch you in case your feet do not
quite clear.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Long Swing.</span></h5>

<p>This is perhaps the most difficult of all the exercises on the bar, and requires
great strength and nerve for its accomplishment. There are very few gymnasts
who can do it properly, which is not to be wondered at, considering the amount of
practice that it involves. Only the advanced gymnasts, those who have completely
mastered all the foregoing exercises (especially the clear circle, which is the
preliminary to the long swing), should attempt it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI30">
<img src="images/illo030d.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="350" height="268" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 30</p>
</div>

<p>Start from position as in <a href="#FigI06">Fig. 6</a>, and raise the body up (<a href="#FigI30">Fig. 30</a>),
then descend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
with a dashing swing (<a href="#FigI31">Fig. 31</a>), bending the body backward, and just as you are
underneath the bar throw the legs forward and the head back. This will have the
effect of bringing you up above the bar. You must now bend the arms slightly, to
bring you nearer the bar, over which you should come with the chest thrown out.
This position is the most awkward part of the whole swing, for the hands will be
found too far over the bar. To rectify this you must make what is known as the
shift, which consists of making a rapid turn with the hands, bringing the palms on
to the top of the bar, when you can straighten the arms (<a href="#FigI32">Fig. 32</a>), ready for another
circle.</p>

<div class="figc600">

<div class="figleft" id="FigI31">

<p class="caption">Fig. 32</p>
</div>

</div><!--figc600-->

<p>The long swing can also be performed forward, but it is even more difficult
than the one just described.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Combinations.</span></h5>

<p>We have now shown most of the principal movements on the horizontal bar, a
great many of which, when properly acquired singly, can be performed in combination.
For instance&mdash;</p>

<p>Start with the short circle, throw the legs over the bar into sitting position, then
sit swing backwards, leave go with the hands, two hock swing backwards, and off
the bar on to your feet as in <a href="#FigI18">Fig. 18</a>.</p>

<p>Again. Upstart, clear circle (three or four times) into sitting position, sit swing
forward, change hands, and hock swing off.</p>

<p>A very dashing-looking feat is the upstart and splits in one movement. Care
must be taken not to allow the body to touch the bar, or your impetus will be
stopped just when it is required for clearing the bar.</p>

<p>This concludes the Horizontal Bar. We will now proceed to describe the
exercises on the Parallel Bars.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Parallel Bars.</span></h5>

<p>The Parallel Bars are very simple in their structure. They consist of two bars,
running side by side, supported by uprights at a sufficient height from the ground
to allow the feet to swing clear. The width should not be more than eighteen
inches; length about seven feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The exercises that can be performed upon this apparatus are various and
attractive; some of them comparatively easy, the more advanced very difficult, and
requiring great strength and skill in their execution.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Exercises.</span></h5>

<p>Rise into position as in <a href="#FigI33">Fig. 33</a>, and walk with the hands to the end of the
bars, keeping the arms stiff, legs straight, and toes pointed. Now walk back again.
Now proceed along the bars by a succession of jumps with the hands and back
again.</p>

<div class="figc530">

</div>

</div><!--figc530-->

<p>Let the body sink down, as in <a href="#FigI34">Fig. 34</a>, and hop along in that position forwards
and backwards. Be careful to keep the body steady and legs straight.</p>

</div><!--figc600-->

<p>Position as in <a href="#FigI33">Fig. 33</a>. Now commence swinging the legs backwards and
forwards. When accustomed to this movement, throw the legs over the bars in
front of you (<a href="#FigI35">Fig. 35</a>), then bring the hands to the front
(<a href="#FigI36">Fig. 36</a>), and bring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
legs over again between the bars into original position. Do this several times in
succession, and vary the exercise by commencing with throwing the legs behind.</p>

<p>The <i>pumping movement</i> is a splendid exercise for bringing out the muscles of
the chest, and is performed as follows. Swing the body into a horizontal position,
as in <a href="#FigI37">Fig. 37</a>; then bend the arms and drop into <a href="#FigI38">Fig. 38</a>. Swing the legs forward,
and with the impulse this will give you come up into <a href="#FigI39">Fig. 39</a>, and finish with a
swing back into position from which the movement was commenced. In the
backward &#8216;pump,&#8217; commence from the position as shown in last figure, and drop
with the backward swing. It is a pretty movement to combine the two&mdash;first
forwards, then backwards, in alternate swings, and then to leave the bars by a side
movement on to your feet, as in <a href="#FigI40">Fig. 40</a>. This last movement is one of the neatest
and easiest ways of leaving the bars, and can be done either forwards or backwards,
and on right or left side.</p>

<div class="figc475">

<div class="figleft" id="FigI41">

<p>After having fairly mastered the pumping movement, you will now be ready for
attempting <i>the hand-balance</i>&mdash;an exceedingly effective exercise, and not very
difficult to accomplish. Commence as for the backward pump, and, with an
increased momentum, bring yourself up into a hand-balance (<a href="#FigI41">Fig. 41</a>). This movement
should be first practised at the end of the bars, as in the event of your
overbalancing&mdash;a not unlikely contingency&mdash;you can save yourself by bending
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
arms, as in <a href="#FigI42">Fig. 42</a>. We should also recommend your having two friends to stand
by you, one on each side of the bars, ready to catch you in case of a tumble.
Having become proficient in the stationary balance, try to walk along the whole
length of bars with the hands, still preserving the balance. This will be found none
too easy, as directly one hand is moved forward the balance is altered, and there is a
tendency to fall over. The correct method of leaving the bars after balancing is by
means of the <i>hand-spring</i>, which is performed by bending the arms as in <a href="#FigI42">Fig. 42</a>,
and when in that position dropping the legs and pushing away from the bars with
the arms; the result will be that you will alight on your feet after having turned a
half-somersault. In practising this also you should have two friends ready to catch
you, as your first few attempts are nearly certain to be unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The <a href="#Ref04">slow pull-up</a> was described in our remarks on the Horizontal Bar, but upon
the parallels it is much more difficult of execution. The movement is shown in
<a href="#FigI43">Figs. 43</a> and <a href="#FigI44">44</a>. In starting, the hands should be placed well over the ends of the
bars&mdash;the wrists, in fact, being over&mdash;then by sheer strength raise the body up
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
<a href="#FigI44">Fig. 44</a>. This is the awkward point, and all your exertion and power will be called
upon to get right up with straight arms.</p>

<p>The following exercise is also very similar to one described for the horizontal
bar, but it is more difficult on the parallels. Stand between the bars, catch hold of
them with the hands, and stoop down until the shoulders are level with the bars;
then raise the legs&mdash;keeping them straight&mdash;until the body is in position, as in
<a href="#FigI45">Fig. 45</a>, when drop right over to <a href="#FigI46">Fig. 46</a>; then back again, and continue the movement
several times. This is splendid exercise for opening the chest and strengthening
the muscles of the back.</p>

<p>Vaulting movements, when neatly performed, are very pretty, and should be
commenced from the centre of and between the bars. <a href="#FigI47">Figs. 47</a> and <a href="#FigI48">48</a> will convey
the idea to our readers. A great many movements may be gone through while in
this position, the necessary impetus being obtained by swinging the legs over the
bars.</p>

<p><a href="#FigI49">Fig. 49</a> shows the most difficult of all the exercises upon the parallels. It is to
make the head and shoulders counterbalance the legs, and to hold the body parallel
with the bars by the arms. This is known by the name of &#8216;La Planche.&#8217;</p>

<p>We will now proceed to a description of the exercises on the</p>

<h5 id="Ref03"><span class="smcap">Vaulting Horse.</span></h5>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI50">
<img src="images/illo035d.jpg" alt="vaulting horse" width="432" height="300" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 50</p>
</div>

<p>The above sketch shows the apparatus (<a href="#FigI50">Fig. 50</a>). The dimensions most
convenient for use are 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet in length, and about 16
inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
across the back; the height can be arranged as required. It will be seen from the
illustration that the legs are telescopic, and can be lengthened or reduced at pleasure.</p>

<p id="Ref05">The two pommels in the centre are about 18 inches apart, and can be removed
for certain exercises hereafter described. In that case, pommels level with the back
of the horse are inserted to fill up the grooves. In performing a great many of the
exercises it is necessary to have a wooden board about 3 feet square, rising in
thickness from a feather edge to 3 inches, to be placed on the ground at the side or
end of the horse, as the case may be, for the &#8216;take-off.&#8217; This is not used as a
spring-board. It should be solid, and made of deal.</p>

<p>The trunk of the horse is made of a solid piece of wood, and covered all over
with cowhide. One end, as will be seen from the <a href="#FigI50">engraving</a>, is raised, with a
slight bend corresponding to the neck of the animal, which gives it its name.</p>

<p>Many of the exercises upon the horse are similar to those upon the parallels.
Our readers can themselves recognise which they are; we shall therefore avoid
recapitulation, and only describe those peculiar to the horse.</p>

</div><!--figc550-->

<p>Start by springing on to the horse with the hands one on each of the pommels,
legs hanging straight (<a href="#FigI51">Fig. 51</a>). Now swing the right leg over the horse in between
the pommels (as in <a href="#FigI52">Fig. 52</a>), momentarily relinquishing the hold of the right hand,
and immediately the leg has passed resuming your hold; then the same with the
left leg. This must be done without touching the horse with the foot, and the body
must be supported by the arms the whole time. Then bring each leg back again
into original position.</p>

<p>Now try the two movements at once&mdash;that is, while the one leg is being brought
back the other is to be passed through forward. You will thus always have one leg
on each side of the horse.</p>

<p>The next exercise is the&mdash;</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Leg Spring.</span></h5>

<p>Stand in front of the horse, hands on pommels, then spring up into the
saddle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
into a kneeling position (as in <a href="#FigI53">Fig. 53</a>). Then, throwing the arms up, give a good
spring forward, alighting on your feet the other side (<a href="#FigI54">Fig. 54</a>). You will feel rather
awkward at first in attempting the spring, as the legs seem to be glued to the saddle,
but it is very easy after having once been accomplished.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Horse Jumping.</span></h5>

<p>Jumping exercises on the horse, when neatly performed, are very effective.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI55">
<img src="images/illo037c.jpg" alt="vaulting horse" width="288" height="300" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 55</p>
</div>

<p>Take a short run up to the board (described <a href="#Ref05">above</a>), and jump&mdash;off both feet at
once&mdash;over the back, passing the legs through the arms, and assisting yourself by
the hands one on each pommel (<a href="#FigI55">Fig. 55</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI56">
<img src="images/illo037d.jpg" alt="vaulting horse" width="377" height="300" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 56</p>
</div>

<p>When in this position shoot out the legs in front of you, and, leaving go of the
pommels, come down neatly on the other side. Be careful to gather up the legs
well when passing through, or you may catch your feet against the back of the
horse, and come down on your nose. There are several forms of this exercise.
<a href="#FigI56">Fig. 56</a> shows one of them.</p>

<p>It is rather more difficult than the last, from the legs passing <i>outside</i> the hands.
A much greater spring is required to raise you high enough to pass over, and you
must be careful to let go with the hands at the proper time, otherwise you will lose
command of yourself and pitch forward on to the ground. In practising this movement
we recommend your having a friend to stand in front of the horse, to catch you
in case of such an emergency.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Saddle Vaulting.</span></h5>

<p>Get on to the horse as in <a href="#FigI57">Fig. 57</a>, sitting across, outside the pommels, then
catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
hold of the pommels as shown, and, throwing the whole weight of the body upon
the arms, throw the legs right up, and, with a kind of twist, bring yourself round on
to the horse the opposite side of the pommels, retaining your hold all the time.
You will then face the opposite direction to the position from which you started.
Practise the exercise from right to left, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI57">
<img src="images/illo037e.jpg" alt="vaulting horse" width="307" height="325" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 57</p>
</div>

<p>There are many other forms of saddle-vaulting possible of practice, some of
them very difficult, but it is not needful to describe them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI58">
<img src="images/illo038a.jpg" alt="vaulting horse" width="113" height="350" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 58</p>
</div>

<p>The hand-balance was described in the chapter on the parallel bars. It is a
little more difficult of execution on the horse. It is shown in <a href="#FigI58">Fig. 58</a>.</p>

<p>The assistance of two friends in attempting this feat is desirable.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Flying over the Horse.</span></h5>

<p>For these exercises the pommels must be removed, and the spaces filled up
with the flush ones, as <a href="#Ref05">described</a> already. The movement is not unlike leap-frog,
as the spring is taken off the board, and you pitch on to your hands in the same
manner. But there the similarity ends, for it is a very different matter clearing a
boy&#8217;s back, from getting over the whole length of the horse.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI59">
<img src="images/illo038b.jpg" alt="vaulting horse" width="388" height="300" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 59</p>
</div>

<p>Commence by placing the jumping-board about 3 feet from the largest end of
the horse, then with a run and a spring pitch on to your hands, as in <a href="#FigI59">Fig. 59</a>.</p>

<p>After practising this, move the board farther away and repeat; continue the
exercise, each time measuring the distance, until you can pitch on to the ends from
about 5 or 6 feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI60">
<img src="images/illo038c.jpg" alt="vaulting horse" width="211" height="325" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 60</p>
</div>

<p>Now jump up on to the end of the horse, as in <a href="#FigI60">Fig. 60</a>, then plunge forwards
on to the other end, pitching on to the hands, and clearing the horse, as in leap-frog,
coming down safely on the ground in front.</p>

<p>This exercise must be done with dash and vigour. If you are half-hearted
about it you will come to grief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Hand-rings or Stirrups.</span></h5>

<p>This simple apparatus consists of iron rings attached to two ropes suspended
from a cross bar or from a ceiling, about seventeen or eighteen feet in length, and
at a sufficient height from the ground to allow the feet to swing just clear. The
rings or stirrups (the latter shape is the more convenient) should be covered with
leather, and of a thickness affording a good grasp. The exercises that can be
performed upon them are neither attractive nor various, but they are useful, and as
no section on gymnastics would be complete without their introduction, we will
proceed to describe them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI61">
<img src="images/illo039a.jpg" alt="hand-rings" width="170" height="350" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 61</p>
</div>

<p>Begin by drawing yourself up, as in <a href="#FigI61">Fig. 61</a>, holding one ring close to the
shoulder and the other extended at arm&#8217;s length. Now draw in the extended arm,
at the same time straightening the other, and repeat the movement as long as you
are able, first one arm straight, then the other. Keep the head erect, looking
straight before you, not at either of the rings. Legs hanging close together, toes
pointed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI62">
<img src="images/illo039b.jpg" alt="hand-rings" width="258" height="350" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 62</p>
</div>

<p>Now try the slow pull up; this is not so difficult upon the rings as upon the
horizontal bar. The wrist should be placed well over the rings, so as to get a good
purchase. Then proceed as directed in the horizontal bar directions, and when you
have drawn yourself quite up, straighten the arms and press them close to your
sides. Now for a stiff one. When in this position gradually extend the arms
apart, allowing the body to sink until the shoulders are nearly level with the rings
(<a href="#FigI62">Fig. 62</a>). Endeavour to keep in this position, supporting the body as long as
possible, then lower yourself gradually, until you hang straight down again.</p>

<p>The back and forward &#8216;horizontals&#8217; (also described in the horizontal bar) are
very good exercises to practise on the rings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI63">
<img src="images/illo040a.jpg" alt="hand-rings" width="400" height="213" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 63</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI64">
<img src="images/illo040b.jpg" alt="hand-rings" width="240" height="250" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 64</p>
</div>

<p>Now for some swinging exercises. Take hold of the rings and with a few quick
steps forward communicate a swing to the body, which increase by drawing yourself
up in the forward swing, and when at its extent lowering yourself with a
drop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
This will cause you to swing higher each time until your arms and legs are straight
and nearly in a horizontal position, as in <a href="#FigI63">Fig. 63</a>. When accustomed to this
exercise, which should be practised until perfect confidence is attained, you may
proceed to the following. Commence as before, and when at the end of the
forward swing, draw up the legs over the head, as in <a href="#FigI64">Fig. 64</a>, and immediately
before commencing the backward swing shoot the legs out straight, and come back
to position as in <a href="#FigI63">Fig. 63</a>. Continue the movement half a dozen times.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI65">
<img src="images/illo040c.jpg" alt="hand-rings" width="334" height="250" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 65</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI66">
<img src="images/illo040d.jpg" alt="hand-rings" width="400" height="226" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 66</p>
</div>

<p>Commence as before, and when at the end of the <i>backward</i> swing, suddenly
contract the arms and raise yourself up into the rings, as in <a href="#FigI65">Fig. 65</a>, and continue
swinging in that position. In order to preserve your equilibrium you must bring
the legs forward when beginning to descend, as in <a href="#FigI66">Fig. 66</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI67">
<img src="images/illo040e.jpg" alt="hand-rings" width="400" height="160" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 67</p>
</div>

<p>Another variety of the swing is to support yourself on the rings, &#8216;grasshopper
fashion&#8217; (<a href="#FigI67">Fig. 67</a>). A very pretty effect is produced by a combination of the
different swings we have described. The order in which they are performed is
immaterial, and may be left to the pleasure of the gymnast.</p>

<p>We will conclude our directions for the rings with a description of what is
known as &#8216;dislocation.&#8217;</p>

<p>Hang from the rings and draw up the legs over the head, and drop over, as in
<a href="#FigI46">Fig. 46</a> (Parallel Bars). Now instead of going back again, push the rings out and
away from you on each side. The body, by its own weight, will drop through and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
cause the arms to twist until you will find yourself hanging with straight arms in
the position from which you started. The sensation you will experience when first
the exercise is performed is (of course momentarily only) not unlike &#8216;dislocation,&#8217;
hence the name the exercise bears, but after a few successful attempts it is comparatively
easy, and is a splendid means of opening the chest.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Climbing.</span></h5>

<p>Although not generally looked upon as a gymnastic exercise, climbing the rope,
pole, etc., is so essentially useful, and so likely to prove of service in an emergency,
that we devote a few lines to describe the best and most effective method. Those
who have never attempted to climb a rope can have but little idea of the severe
nature of the exercise. Although unfortunately neglected, in favour of more showy
feats by the majority of gymnasts, yet there are a few who make a speciality of it,
and climb heights really marvellous. A few years ago, on the occasion of the
German Gymnastic Society&#8217;s annual display at the Crystal Palace, one of the
members ascended a rope from the floor to the extreme height of the centre transept.
The arduous nature of the feat may be imagined when our readers are informed
that a quarter of an hour was occupied in the ascent. The way of taking hold of
the rope is shown in <a href="#FigI68">Fig. 68</a>. The legs should now be drawn up and the knees
and feet pressed against the rope, and the hands then shifted higher (<a href="#FigI69">Fig. 69</a>).</p>

<div class="figc250">

</div><!--figc250-->

<p>Climbing by the hands only, &#8216;hand over hand,&#8217; as it is called, is much
more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
difficult, and can only be performed to a limited height. Climbing the pole is more
difficult, from the fact that it is unbending and thicker to grasp. <a href="#FigI70">Fig. 70</a> shows the
position.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI70">
<img src="images/illo041c.jpg" alt="climbing" width="74" height="350" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 70</p>
</div>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Ladder.</span></h5>

<p>In nearly every well-appointed gymnasium there are ladders, placed in horizontal
or slanting positions, upon which a variety of easy but useful exercises may
be performed. &#8216;Walking&#8217; by the hands is shown on the horizontal ladder in <a href="#FigI71">Fig.
71</a>. By moving the hands forward alternately, holding by the outside, you progress
from one end to the other, and back again by reversing the movement.</p>

<div class="figc450">

</div><!--figc450-->

<p>In <a href="#FigI72">Fig. 72</a> another movement is shown, in which progression is made by a
succession of &#8216;steps&#8217; from round to round, first from one round to the next, and
afterwards increasing the length of the step by missing four, five, or six rounds, as
the length of reach will permit.</p>

<h4>IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">How to make Gymnastic Apparatus.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">By Charles Spencer</span>, Author of <i>The Modern Gymnast</i>, &amp;c.</h4>

<p>Comparatively few years ago bodily exercises were mostly confined to walking,
running, and rowing; now, happily, it is an exception not to find some sort of
gymnastic exercise desired by boys where apparatus is necessary. My object in
this article is to tell as briefly and succinctly as possible, how any one, with a
slight knowledge of carpentry, can make at home all that is requisite for a
gymnasium, and that too at a comparatively small expense.</p>

<p>As you will, of course, require some tools, I will begin by supposing that you
have the ordinary commonplace ones, but may mention that, as you will find
the truth of the adage, &#8216;A bad workman finds fault with his tools,&#8217; you
must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
not attempt to cross-cut a piece of timber with a rip saw, or split your wood by
using a gimlet instead of a bradawl, blaming the tools, spoiling the wood and
also your own temper.</p>

<p>Let us begin with the construction of the horizontal bar, as it is the simplest
apparatus to make, and affords the greatest variety of exercises. There are
several ways of forming the supports. We will take the two most suitable, one
as a fixture and the other portable, to be used in a room or anywhere else
desired.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done is to order your wood of the nearest timber-merchant.
There are various kinds of fir-timber, and those mostly used are
pine, spruce, and yellow deal. The latter is the best for our present purpose,
as it is easy to work and will best stand the inclemency of the weather. I
need scarcely tell you where to get the other materials, as most ironmongers
and colourmen keep everything you may require in this way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI01a">
<img src="images/illo044a.jpg" alt="horizontal bar" width="376" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1</p>
</div>

<p>Having all your materials and tools ready, saw 4 feet off your battens (<span class="smcapall">A</span>
<span class="smcapall">A</span>),
which will leave 10 feet for the uprights, and as 2 feet 6 inches have to be
let into the ground, you will then have 7 feet 6 inches for the height of the
bar, which is sufficient for all exercises. You will next fit the 4 feet-pieces
(<span class="smcapall">B</span> <span class="smcapall">B</span>) into one end of
the uprights by halving them in; this will form the sole-piece
to which the struts (<span class="smcapall">C</span> <span class="smcapall">C</span>
<span class="smcapall">C</span> <span class="smcapall">C</span>) are nailed. All this part, which goes
underground, is left in its rough state; the 7 feet 6 inches above the ground
will have to be planed over and the edges rounded off. The uprights can be
either left plain or an ornamental turned top may be added. This is a matter
of fancy.</p>

<p>Our bar is made of the best straight-grained ash, 6 feet long and 1<sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. in
diameter.</p>

<p>Before fixing, cover the knots with a little patent knotting, then paint the
uprights all over with a coat of priming, another coat of lead colour and one
of any finishing colour you prefer. Green will soon fade, blue will stand for years.</p>

<p>This bar (<a href="#FigI02a">Fig. 2</a>), for its simplicity, portability, and strength, has a reputation
for being one of the most useful kinds of apparatus made. Not only
is it used for a bar, but children&#8217;s swings, hand-rings, and trapeze can be
attached to it, as the supports can be spread out to allow the bar to stand at
various heights by shifting the stretcher irons (<span class="smcapall">A A</span>) up and down. These
irons, three-eighths of a inch in diameter, are cranked at each end&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, bent at
right-angles&mdash;and fit into holes in the uprights about 3 inches apart.</p>

<p>There will be very little for you to make in this, viz., the four uprights.
After you have planed these over and rounded the edges, mortice 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-in. square
holes through two of the uprights (<span class="smcapall">D</span>), six inches from the top, and bore <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-in.
round holes through the other two. This is to take the end of the bar
(<span class="smcapall">B</span>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
The square part is to prevent the bar turning round when you swing on it.

<p><a href="#FigI03a">Fig. 3</a> represents the Lawn Gymnasium with some of its appendages. My
object now is to show you how to construct the frame, and, of course, when
that is done you can add whatever you like, as, for instance, climbing-rope or
pole, hand-rings (<span class="smcapall">H H</span>), trapeze bar, foot or sitting swing (<span class="smcapall">G</span>), vaulting and
horizontal bar (<span class="smcapall">F</span>), etc.</p>

<p>On referring to the quantities you will find there are two yellow battens<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
15 ft. long; these form the uprights (<span class="smcapall">A A</span>); 3 feet has to go into the ground,
leaving 12 feet for the height of the swing. The top (<span class="smcapall">B</span>), 7 feet in length, is
cut off the 14-ft. length, the remaining 7 ft. is again cut in the centre to form
the two sole-pieces (<span class="smcapall">D D</span>), 3 ft. 6 in. each; these are then halved into the
bottom of the uprights in centre, and the struts (<span class="smcapall">E E E E</span>) nailed on as shown.
The top can be either morticed on to the uprights or secured by strong iron
brackets. The inch facia board (<span class="smcapall">C</span>) is nailed on the top for ornament, as are
also the cornice pole-ends.</p>

<p>The 2-inch square runners are secured on the uprights with the 3-inch screws
(four to each runner), 3 feet from the ground and 2 inches apart, leaving a
groove or space between them for the ends of the bar to slide up and down.
For vaulting purposes these runners have to be bored through with a <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-in. nose
or spoon-bit (a gimlet would split the wood); the holes must be about three
inches apart from the top to bottom, and are intended to take the <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-in. pin
which is to support the bar.</p>

<p>The whole of the wood-work above ground must be planed, and the edges
neatly rounded off. It is the custom to burn or char the surface of that part
of the timber which has to be let into the ground, to prevent it from rotting,
but a good coat of gas tar answers the purpose very well.</p>

<p><a href="#FigI04_a">Fig. 4</a> represents a very simple way of forming the uprights for a swing.
It consists of two scaffold poles, or more correctly speaking, Norway spars (the
same as used for ladder-making when they have been sawn down the centre).
They may be procured at any ladder-makers, with the bark taken off and properly
trimmed. The top should be 2 in. in diameter, and the bottom 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to
4 inches. The cross-piece (<span class="smcapall">B</span>) to which the ropes are fastened is formed of
2-in. gas barrel, <i>i.e.</i> iron tubing, and is measured by the calibre or inside
diameter, therefore 2-inch gas tubes will measure about 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches outside
diameter. The elbows, which are bought already screwed, would have to be
fitted with iron staples riveted to them, to fasten the wire rope to, and two
hooks also riveted through the tube, made of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-in. diameter iron, 18 inches
apart, for attaching the swing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Cut the iron rope into four lengths of 25 ft. to form the stays (<span class="smcapall">C C C C</span>).
One of these stays must be fitted with a coupling screw, for tightening the
whole, when fixed. Most telegraph-posts are stayed in this manner; they
would, therefore, be a good guide for you to see how the wire ropes are fastened.</p>

<p>The two uprights are not let into the ground; it is best to let them stand
on some hard substance, such as a stone or a block of wood, to prevent their
sinking when the stays are strained.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigI05a">

<p class="caption">Fig. 5</p>
</div>

<p>The next illustration (<a href="#FigI05a">Fig. 5</a>) represents another method of constructing a
portable frame. This has the advantage of the uprights being readily removed,
as the whole consists of tube-iron. The Norway spars are here represented
by two 14-feet lengths of 2-inch gas tube. If, however, the length be a
difficulty, then get four 7-feet lengths of 2-inch gas tube, two of which may be
screwed together to form one upright. The screwed sockets, by means of
which the tubes are joined, are supplied with them. A horizontal bar (<span class="smcapall">D</span>) may
be added by introducing the <span class="lettsymb">T</span> pieces (<span class="smcapall">A A</span>),
which should be 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches, to
slide up and down the iron tube, and a hole drilled through the <span class="lettsymb">T</span> piece and
into the tube will enable it to be fixed at the requisite height.</p>

<p>The four stays (<span class="smcapall">F F F F</span>) and stakes (<span class="smcapall">G G G G</span>) just the same as described
in <a href="#FigI04_a">Fig. 4</a>.</p>

<p>Any gas-fitter would supply these tubes, but on the score of economy it is
best to go to a wholesale house.</p>

</div>

<p>Jumping stands are very simple in their construction, consisting of two
pieces of square timber (<span class="smcapall">A A</span>) about 4 inches square, bolted to cross-piece
(<span class="smcapall">B B</span>) (<a href="#FigI06a">Fig. 6</a>). In many instances they are merely sunk into the ground without
any sole-pieces or struts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>For foot-jumping the stands average 6 feet in height, with three-eighths of an
inch holes bored from top to 1 foot from bottom. They are painted and marked
feet and inches. A line and sandbags (<span class="smcapall">D D</span>) rest on two pins inserted in the
three-eighths-of-an-inch holes, so that should the foot catch in the act of jumping
the line immediately falls off.</p>

<p>For pole-jumping the stands must be 12 feet high and strong in proportion,
while in other respects they are the same as for foot-jumping.</p>

<p>This combination (<a href="#FigI07a">Fig. 7</a>) consists of a ladder-plank (<span class="smcapall">A</span>), two standing-planks
(<span class="smcapall">D D</span>), and standing-ladder (<span class="smcapall">B</span>),
all fourteen feet in length, which form the four
supports to carry the cross-beam (<span class="smcapall">E</span>), ten feet long, to which may be suspended
any apparatus you may wish. This is very similar to the Portable Horizontal
Bar (<a href="#FigI02a">Fig. 2</a>), only carried out upon a large and more elaborate scale. If I were
to describe its general construction, I should be merely recapitulating what has
already been explained. This apparatus may be made any size, of course proportionately

<h3>CHAPTER II.&mdash;INDIAN CLUBS, AND HOW TO USE THEM.<br />
<span class="smcap">By a Member of the London Athletic Club.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">It is our object in this chapter to present to our readers full instructions for the
use of the Indian clubs&mdash;instructions that, for completeness and thoroughness of
illustration, have not before been approached in any work with which we are
acquainted.</p>

<p>The origin of their introduction into Europe is not known with certainty, but
it is said that we are indebted for them to a military officer who had seen them in
use by the Persians. The movements that can be performed with the clubs are
almost unlimited in their variety, and are amongst the most useful and beneficial of
any gymnastic exercises, having the effect of increasing the muscular power of the
shoulders and arms, strengthening the hands and wrists, opening the chest, and
also possessing the advantage of rendering the user ambidextrous, or two-handed&mdash;that
is, of making the left arm, shoulder, etc., as vigorous and able as the right,
and developing equally both sides of the body.</p>

<p>If practised properly, the exercises are exceedingly pretty and graceful, and
cause the performer to acquire a good carriage and deportment. Although in
almost every gymnasium Indian clubs are now to be found, it is surprising
how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
seldom they are used, the pupils generally preferring to acquire proficiency in the
more showy feats that other instruments&mdash;such as the horizontal and parallel bars&mdash;permit
of their practising. But we would impress upon our readers that if they
will only exercise a little patience and perseverance in acquiring the use of the
clubs, they will find that no other gymnastic exercises can surpass them in grace
and utility, and give such pleasure both to the performer and his audience.</p>

<p>The advantages of the clubs are many; amongst others&mdash;(1) they are inexpensive;
(2) there is no danger attached to their use; (3) being portable, there is no
fixing required&mdash;they can be used either in the open air or in a room; (4) their
weight can be adapted to the age and strength of the user.</p>

<p>With regard to the price, they can be obtained of any wood-turner at about
4<i>d.</i> per pound (unpolished).
We should certainly
recommend the
learner to purchase <i>un</i>polished
clubs, for in the
course of practice he is
sure to bruise them by
knocking them together,
and the damage shows
more plainly upon a
polished than an unpolished
surface. But
when he has become
accustomed to the manipulation
of the clubs,
then he may obtain the
more showy article, the
cost of which is about
6<i>d.</i> per lb.</p>

<p>Of course, every boy
will know that the clubs
are made of wood.
American elm is the
best kind and mostly in
use. Sometimes they are turned out of a lighter wood&mdash;such as deal&mdash;and are
weighed to the required extent by molten lead being poured into a hole at the
bottom of the club; but we must caution the would-be &#8216;clubbist&#8217; against buying
such an article, for the weight should not be concentrated at the <i>bottom</i>, but should
be contained in the wood itself, which allows of the club being properly <i>balanced</i>,
without which true grace and elegance can never be acquired.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Weight of the Clubs.</span></h4>

<p>We now come to a most important consideration&mdash;viz., the weight to be used,
which should be in proportion to the strength and weight of the performer. It
is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
almost impossible to lay down any law upon the subject, but the following scale
may be taken as a guide<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>These figures refer only to the light clubs or dual exercises&mdash;that is, when a
club is used in each hand. For the single or &#8216;heavy club&#8217; exercises, of course,
the weight can be increased, but of that we will treat later on.</p>

<p>Many of our readers may consider these weights &#8216;a mere nothing,&#8217; and quite
unworthy of their muscular powers. But it is a great mistake to suppose that the
benefit to be obtained from Indian clubs is in proportion to their weight, and in the
exertion required in manipulating them. On the contrary, the easier the exercise
(within reasonable limits, of course), the better, for practice being then a pleasure,
it can be sustained for a longer period, and by this means the muscles become
gradually developed and subsequent fatigue is avoided.</p>

<p>We have said that the weight of the club should be in proportion to the <i>weight</i>
of the user. We will justify this advice by an explanation. We will suppose that
a boy twelve years of age weighs six stone, and another boy of the same age
weighs six stone and seven pounds; the latter (presuming both boys&#8217; muscular
development to be about equal) could use a heavier pair of clubs than the
former,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
because he would have greater weight in his body to counterbalance the weight of
the clubs.</p>

<p>In order to impress our readers with the correctness of this principle we
would point out to them that, in performing exercises upon a fixed gymnastic
apparatus (such as the horizontal bar), the gymnast has only to use muscular
exertion proportionate to his bodily weight. If, however, he were to carry about
him any weighty articles, or even wear a pair of heavy boots, he would experience
a greater difficulty in performing the exercises, and perhaps fail altogether, and his
exertions would soon produce fatigue. Therefore, do not be too ambitious in
selecting your clubs, but be contented with the weights we have recommended,
which, although they may appear small <i>on paper</i>, will be found quite heavy enough
<i>in practice</i>. The writer, who has used the Indian clubs constantly for the last ten
years, never has a pair of greater weight than eight pounds each.</p>

<p>The length of the clubs must be varied to the height of the performer. With
the clubs standing on the ground and the hands hanging down, as in <a href="#FigII01">Fig. 1</a>, there
should be a space of about two inches between the handles and the tips of the
fingers, so that it becomes necessary to stoop slightly in order to grasp the clubs.
When swung round they should clear the tops of the toes by about two inches.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Hints as to Dress, etc.</span></h5>

<p>With regard to dress, the ordinary gymnastic suit is the most suitable. &#8216;The
best material is undoubtedly white flannel. A pair of flannel trousers made to fit
the legs tolerably closely, with plenty of room in the seat (not baggy, of course), a
close-fitting ordinary under-jersey minus the sleeves (to give freedom to the arms),
and a pair of canvas shoes without heels, are all that are necessary for wear during
actual practice. Add to these a loose jacket of medium thickness to slip on during
intervals of rest, and you have your costume complete.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>But for Indian club exercise a special costume is not indispensable&mdash;and here,
again, their economy is manifested&mdash;and all that need be done is to divest oneself of
coat, vest, and over-shirt, and practise in ordinary trousers, boots, and undershirt.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to describe the different exercises, we would impress upon
the reader most emphatically that, in endeavouring to perfect himself in them, he
should bear in mind that, performed <i>gracefully</i>, and with an easy, swinging motion,
there is nothing prettier. On the other hand, a jerky and strained action spoils
entirely not only the effect from a spectator&#8217;s point of view, but also neutralises
the benefit that should accrue to the performer.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Exercises for Light Clubs.</span></h5>

<p><i>First Position</i> (<a href="#FigII01">Fig. 1</a>). Place the clubs upon the ground, one upon the right
and one upon the left side,
slightly in front&mdash;about
level with the toes. Stand
at attention, head erect,
shoulders square. Then
bend down, grasp the clubs,
one in each hand, and raise
them up until the hands are
level with the shoulders, at
the same time separating
the legs and placing the
feet apart, toes pointing
outwards (as in <a href="#FigII02">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p id="Ref07">You will then be in
position to commence
<i>Exercise</i> 1 (<a href="#FigII03">Fig. 3</a>). Throw
out the clubs to the right,
and describe a complete
circle with them in front of
the body from the right to
the left, <i>keeping the arms
perfectly straight and in a
line with the clubs</i>. As they
describe the circle the body
should be turned slightly in the same direction, and the head and eyes also should
follow the course of the clubs from right to left. Continue this exercise at least a
dozen times. Should you find any difficulty in accomplishing this with both clubs
at once, try one at a time, first with the right hand and then with the left, or <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

<p>Here we will take the opportunity of informing the learner that he should
endeavour to <i>identify</i> himself, so to speak, with the clubs, and consider that they
are parts of himself&mdash;continuations, in fact, of his own arms. The base of the club
should always be kept in a straight line with the shoulder. By this means an equal
distance is preserved between the two clubs; otherwise, should they be swung at
an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
angle, they must surely come into collision in the next exercise (and in many others
to follow), in which one club travels in an opposite direction to the other.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 4</p>
</div>

<p id="Ref06"><i>Exercise</i> 2 (<a href="#FigII04">Fig. 4</a>).&mdash;Commence as before, and when both clubs are raised
above the head, <i>reverse</i> the direction of the left one, and, instead of describing the
circle from right to left, swing it from left to right, the right club at the same time
continuing its original course. A glance at <a href="#FigII04">Fig. 4</a> will show the exercise; the
dotted lines and arrows indicate the direction in which each club travels. In this
exercise (and in many others to follow) the clubs cross twice in each circle; care
must therefore be taken not to allow them to come into collision (which catastrophe
can be easily avoided by following the directions just given&mdash;viz., to keep the
base of each club in a straight line with each shoulder).</p>

<p id="Ref08"><i>Exercise</i> 3 (<a href="#FigII05">Fig. 5</a>).&mdash;This is the same
as <a href="#Ref06">No. 2</a> with an additional movement&mdash;viz.,
that when each club is raised in its turn above the head to its highest point,
the circle is checked and the club dropped behind the head and made to describe
a smaller circle in the rear of the shoulder, after completing which the larger circle
is resumed. The dotted line in the illustration shows the course of the <i>left</i> club
only, but the right club does the same thing in the opposite direction.</p>

<p><i>Exercise</i> 4 (<a href="#FigII06">Fig. 6</a>).&mdash;Commence with <a href="#Ref07">Exercise 1</a>, and when the clubs are raised
above the head allow them to drop and make them describe a small circle behind
the shoulders, then resume the larger circle on front of the body.</p>

<p><i>Exercise</i> 5 (<a href="#FigII07">Fig. 7</a>).&mdash;This is the first of the wrist &#8216;twists,&#8217; and is a movement
that will tax the power of the fore-arm rather severely. Start from the position
shown in <a href="#FigII02">Fig. 2</a>, and describe a circle with each club <i>from
the wrist</i> in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
shown by the dotted lines and arrows. In practising this exercise, you will experience
a tendency to drop the arms with the clubs, but you must endeavour to
keep them in the position shown, <i>making each wrist the centre of each circle</i>.</p>

<p><i>Exercise</i> 6 (<a href="#FigII08">Fig. 8</a>).&mdash;Now for a twist in which each club describes a circle in an
opposite direction. Again be careful to avoid a collision, and keep the wrists level
and opposite each other.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Exercise</i> 7 (<a href="#FigII09">Fig. 9</a>).&mdash;This is rather difficult, but with a little perseverance you
will be able to accomplish the movement, and as it is very pretty it is well worth
the trouble. Carefully study the illustration and follow the course of the dotted
lines (which show the direction of the right club only; the left club takes a corresponding
course in the opposite direction). Keep the hand close up to the chest,
almost touching it, in fact. You will observe that the club describes a <i>small</i> circle
from the centre of the chest, and is then swung completely round at arm&#8217;s length to
make the <i>great</i> circle.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Exercise</i> 8 (<a href="#FigII10">Fig. 10</a>).&mdash;This is a simple swing backwards and forwards, each
club being swung alternately in front of the body and behind the head. When the
right club is extended at arm&#8217;s length almost straight from the shoulder, the left
club is passing behind the head and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

<p><i>Exercise</i> 9 (<a href="#FigII11">Fig. 11</a>).&mdash;This is exactly the
reverse of <a href="#FigII05">Fig. 5</a>. The illustration will
show the movement.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Exercise</i> 10 (<a href="#FigII12">Fig. 12</a>).&mdash;This is very effective, and if performed rapidly and
neatly is sure to elicit applause from an audience. It consists of circles behind
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
head with each club, in the direction shown by the arrows, one club passing in a
downward direction while the other is swinging up.</p>

<img src="images/illo056b.jpg" alt="indian clubs" width="314" height="421" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 13</p>
</div>

<p><i>Exercise</i> 11 (<a href="#FigII13">Fig. 13</a>).&mdash;This is not very difficult to perform. Keep the arms
straight, and beware of a collision. The clubs are swung in a circle across and in
front of the body, passing one another twice in their course&mdash;once when above the
head (as in the <a href="#FigII13">figure</a>) and again in front of the legs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigII14">

<p class="caption">Fig. 14</p>
</div>

<p id="Ref09"><i>Exercise</i> 12 (<a href="#FigII14">Fig. 14</a>).&mdash;Now
this <i>is</i> difficult, and will take a long time to learn.
It is a complication of <a href="#Ref08">Exercise 3</a>. Commence with that, and, having got the
clubs into a good swing, check the course of the right arm, slightly decrease the
pace of the left arm, and throw the right club sharply behind the body, until the
base rises a little above the left shoulder (see <a href="#FigII14">Fig.</a>),
then swing it back to <span class="smcapall">A</span> and <span class="smcapall">B</span>,
and continue the original circle, all this time keeping the other club (the left)
travelling in a circle, until it becomes its turn to effect the movement that the right
one has just completed, and so on, first with the right club behind the body, and
then with the left in front, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. This is one of the best and prettiest
exercises yet described, and will entail long and patient practice; but when
thoroughly acquired it will well repay the perseverance expended upon it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigII15">
<img src="images/illo057b.jpg" alt="indian clubs" width="303" height="310" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 15</p>
</div>

<p><i>Exercise</i> 13 (<a href="#FigII15">Fig. 15</a>).&mdash;Another difficult one. The clubs are swung downwards,
parallel to each other, and then raised up behind the back (as shown by the
dotted arms), then swung to the front again, and in a circle completely round at
arms&#8217; length. The left club executes exactly the same movement as the right in
the last exercise (<a href="#Ref09">12</a>), but with the right club in this the movement is different.
The wrist should be twisted sharply downwards, and the club <i>tucked under</i> the right
arm; its own weight will then carry it down behind the back, and up to a level and
in a line with the right shoulder, reaching that position exactly at the same time
as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the other club, and both will thus again be parallel, but on the opposite side of the
body to that from which they started.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigII16">
<img src="images/illo058a.jpg" alt="indian clubs" width="378" height="358" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 16</p>
</div>

<p><i>Exercise</i> 14 (<a href="#FigII16">Fig. 16</a>).&mdash;This is purely wrist-work. The arms are extended
straight out on each side, and the clubs passed alternately from the wrists in the
front and rear of each arm, describing circles on either side. At the same time that
one club is swinging round behind the right arm, the other is swinging in front of
the left, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. This exercise causes the wrists to become very pliable.</p>

<p>We have now completed our instructions for the &#8216;light clubs.&#8217; The learner
must, of course, acquire the different exercises separately, one by one, but when
mastered they can be continued from one to another, making, when so combined, a
very effective performance. The movements capable of performance with Indian
clubs are almost without limit, but we need not here give further descriptions
or illustrations. The performer will find, as he becomes accustomed to the use
of the clubs, and attains proficiency in their manipulation, that other movements
will suggest themselves, and he will be able perhaps to invent some new and
intricate exercise.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Single or &#8216;Heavy&#8217; Club Exercise.</span></h5>

<p>Roughly speaking, the weight of a club to be used singly should be about the
same as that of the <i>pair</i> the performer is accustomed to&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a boy using two clubs
weighing 6 lb. each should use <i>one</i> weighing just double. This will be found quite
sufficient for sustained movements; if a heavier weight is adopted there is danger
of over-exertion, and the exercise cannot be performed in a graceful and easy
manner. We think the best shape for a heavy club is that shown in <a href="#FigII17">Fig. 17</a>,
which, our readers will observe, differs from the light clubs in having a &#8216;shoulder&#8217;
instead of a gradual slope from handle to base.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigII17">
<img src="images/illo058b.jpg" alt="indian clubs" width="375" height="400" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 17</p>
</div>

<p>All the exercises described above, with a few exceptions, can be
performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
with a heavy club, but, of course, with only one hand at a time&mdash;the other hanging
loosely down by the side (as in <a href="#FigII01">Fig. 1</a>). When one arm becomes tired the club
should be changed to the other (see <a href="#FigII17">Fig. 17</a>), but without the movement of the club
being stopped. The exceptions referred to are the wrist twists, which should not be
attempted with a heavy club, the strain upon that part of the arm being too severe.</p>

<p>It was with considerable diffidence that the writer undertook the task of
penning this chapter, feeling strongly the difficulty of explaining the numerous and
intricate movements in <i>words</i>; but, with the aid of the artist&#8217;s graphic illustrations,
he trusts that the directions will prove sufficiently clear to enable all readers who
desire to become experts in the use of the Indian clubs to succeed fully in their
endeavours.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.&mdash;DUMBBELLS, AND HOW TO USE THEM.<br />
<span class="smcap">By W. J. Gordon.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">In the <a href="#Page_50">previous chapter</a> are given comprehensive instructions on Indian Clubs.
The editor thus gave the clubs the preference, as they are in growing favour
amongst gymnasts, and in regular gymnasia are fast driving out the ancient dumbbell,
owing to their wonderful power of quickly opening the chest and squaring the
shoulders. We say &#8216;ancient dumbbell&#8217; advisedly, for it is at least two thousand
years old. It was first introduced amongst us after being noticed on the Greek
vases. The shape there given differed somewhat from that now in use, but there is
no break in the chain. The oldest form was that of a pointed capital D, the curved
line being the handle; afterwards, as shown on the vases, the athletes adopted the
form (<a href="#FigIIIA">Fig. <span class="smcapall">A</span></a>) from which our present bells are derived. Curiously enough, these
bells were used in springing and leaping, the power given by the weights being well
known to the ancient as well as the modern records. Lawton&#8217;s standing wide jump
of 12ft. 6<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>in. in 1876 was done with dumbbells in his hand, and Howard&#8217;s flying
jump on Chester Racecourse in 1854, when he cleared 29ft. 7in., was done from a
block of wood, with a five-pound dumbbell in each of his hands, quite in the
old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Greek style. However, it is not with the ancient, but the modern, practice that we
have here to do. And we have no space to devote to arch&aelig;ology.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigIIIA">
<img src="images/illo060a.jpg" alt="dumbbells" width="150" height="67" />
<p class="caption">FIG. A.</p>
</div>

<p>In the first place, then, two pounds is quite heavy enough for any dumbbell, and
under any circumstances no bell, even for a full-sized man, should exceed five
pounds. Heavy bells of fifty or even a hundred pounds have been used, but they
are now obsolete. For merely lifting purposes weight was all very well, but as soon
as it was shown that health owed more to suppleness than rigidity, and exercises
were designed in accordance with the new theory, heavy bells became simply
impossible. When they were used by the very strong they were found to give one-sidedness,
and by the weak they could not be worked with at all. Four pounds the
pair is heavy enough for any boy, and most boys when they come to try the exercises
will often wish that the bells were lighter. A word should be said as to price.
Plain bells of cast iron cost from twopence to fourpence per pound; if covered with
leather, and thereby made considerably more comfortable to the hand, the price is
from fourpence to sixpence per pound. For two shillings a lad can get a pair of
bells that will suit him in every way and last him a lifetime. The shape of the bells
does not matter; the heads may be round or octagonal, according to fancy, but the
handle should be thick enough to give a good grip, and it should be half an inch
longer than the hand is wide.</p>

<p>Next, let it be clearly understood that dumbbell practice performed in a slovenly
way does more harm than good. It is essential that the exercises be done in strict
time, not jerkily, but quickly and accurately, as if to the word of command. When
the bells are required to be raised together, they should go up together, not
one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
after the other. When they are required to go up alternately, they should go up
alternately, at equal speed, the left as fast as the right; when they are to be held out
in front together, they should be held out together, and change to the recovery as
soon as the weaker arm begins to yield.</p>

<p>This brings us to our third caution. Never overtire yourself. Ten minutes is
quite long enough to practise at a time. Take the exercises in the order in which
they are given, advancing gradually from the easy to the difficult, succeeding as you
go. Do not practise after much head-work, and do not attempt any of the exercises
before or after a heavy meal, no matter how light the bells may be. The best time
to practise is immediately after the morning bath, and the best costume to wear
is that of the mermaid, or as near an approach to nothing as is consistent with
decency. Of course in gymnasia special dresses are worn; but, as absolute
freedom is required, the model dress of the gymnast should be easily stowable in a
glove-box.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigIII01">
<img src="images/illo060b.jpg" alt="dumbbells" width="156" height="327" />
<p class="caption">FIG. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>And now for the first exercise (<a href="#FigII01">Fig. 1</a>). Stand at attention, holding a bell in
each hand. Let the arms and legs be quite straight, the body upright, the heels
close together, the toes well apart. Hold the bells so that a line through your hips
would pass through the centre of each handle. Move the bells an inch from your
legs, and twist them round, keeping your arms straight and working your wrists.
Do this backwards and forwards with both bells ten times. Then twist the left bell
ten times. Then twist the right ten times; then twist them both together five times;
thirty-five twists altogether, counting each reversal of the hand as one, beginning
with knuckles backwards, and ending with knuckles forwards.</p>

<p>For the second exercise, stand at attention and bend up your forearms only from
the elbow, holding the bells out from your chest with the handles vertical and
parallel. Now twist them ten times simultaneously, and then ten times with the
left hand, ten times with the right, and five times together. Let your elbows be
well back, pressing your sides all through this exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigIII02">
<img src="images/illo060c.jpg" alt="dumbbells" width="279" height="323" />
<p class="caption">FIG. 2.</p>
</div>

<p>For the third exercise, begin at attention, raise your arms from your sides till
they are level with your shoulders, forming one straight line with them (<a href="#FigIII02">Fig. 2</a>).
Let your knuckles be on the top, and do the thirty-five twists as in the former
exercises. The arms must be quite straight, and there must be no giving at the
knees or bending at the waist.</p>

<p>These three exercises are quite enough for the first morning, even though the
bells may be under two pounds apiece. Next time we can run through these three
exercises quickly, and then try something rather more complicated.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigIII03">
<img src="images/illo060d.jpg" alt="dumbbells" width="132" height="400" />
<p class="caption">FIG. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>For the fourth exercise begin at attention, and keeping the elbows against the
sides, double up your arms so as to bring the bells against your shoulders. Open
your chest as far as you can, throw your shoulders well back, and while in this
position take a long deep breath (<a href="#FigIII08">Fig. 8</a>). In fact, in every exercise take long free
breaths as often as possible, so as to expand your chest from within as well as from
without. Bring the bells up and down ten times both together. You are now
ready for the fifth exercise, which consists in bringing the bells from attention up to
the shoulders, as in the fourth exercise, and then thrusting them up straight overhead
(<a href="#FigIII03">Fig. 3</a>). Hold them up as high as you can, keeping your feet on the ground
and body erect. Then do the twists ten times together, ten times with the left, ten
with the right, five together; then with &#8216;one&#8217; to the shoulder, and &#8216;two&#8217; to the
hang, you recover your starting position.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigIII04">
<img src="images/illo061a.jpg" alt="dumbbells" width="145" height="320" />
<p class="caption">FIG. 4.</p>
</div>

<p>In the sixth exercise you bring the bells to the shoulder, and keeping your chest
well open, thrust your arms, not overhead, but straight in front of you (<a href="#FigIII04">Fig. 4</a>), and
again do the thirty-five twists. In the seventh (<a href="#FigIII12">Fig. 12</a>) you bring the bells to the
shoulder and open your arms right and left, holding them out high and well back
at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
full length, then recovering to the shoulder, and then down. Then &#8216;up,&#8217; &#8216;out,&#8217; &#8216;in,&#8217;
&#8216;down&#8217; again, and so on for ten times. Keep your shoulders well back during this
exercise, and do not lose your uprightness! It is a most important and obviously
good practice, should be done with care and regularity, and forms a fitting end to
lesson number two.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigIII05">
<img src="images/illo061b.jpg" alt="dumbbells" width="119" height="326" />
<p class="caption">FIG. 5.</p>
</div>

<p>In our third batch we have said good-bye to the twists. For the eighth exercise
stand at attention, bells to side as before, and always start from attention. Let this
be understood, and it will save repetition. Bring the bells up under the armpits as
far as you can get them (<a href="#FigIII05">Fig. 5</a>). Bring them up together ten times, then ten times
with the left hand, ten times with the right, and five times together.</p>

<p>In the ninth exercise bring the bells up to the armpit, and then extend the
arms right and left, starting with the bells brought up in front of the shoulder and
reaching the same position as in exercise seven. Then bring the bells back to
the armpits and recover. Do this ten times; that will be quite enough for the
first trial.</p>

</div><!--figc275-->

<p>For number ten bring the bells to the armpits, and then take them up overhead
as in exercise five. Up together ten times, then with the left and right alternately
stroke for stroke ten times each (<a href="#FigIII07">Fig. 7</a>). Then try number eleven, in which the
bells are brought to the armpits, then thrust up, brought down to the chest, and
down to the hang&mdash;&#8216;one,&#8217; &#8216;two,&#8217; &#8216;three,&#8217; &#8216;four&#8217;&mdash;ten times together, ten times
alternately. Then try number twelve (<a href="#FigIII06">Fig. 6</a>), in which the bells go to the armpits,
then aloft, then down well back on to the tops of the shoulders, then extended with
a sweep as in number seven, back to chest, and down&mdash;&#8216;one,&#8217; &#8216;two&#8217; aloft,
&#8216;three&#8217; to shoulder, &#8216;four&#8217; to the limit, &#8216;five&#8217; to chest, &#8216;six&#8217; down to hang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p id="Ref10">For our fourth lesson we start as before, upright at attention, ready for the
thirteenth exercise. Bring the bells to the armpits, and then aloft together, and
then keeping them together, bring them down in front, with the arms and legs as
straight as you can until you deposit them at your toes. Then lift them again to
armpits, aloft, and down with a sweep to your toes, ten times in all, three motions
in each.</p>

<p>Now for number fourteen. Lay the bells at the toes from aloft as in <a href="#Ref10">thirteen</a>.
Then make a full step to the rear with the left foot, the right foot following. Make
a half turn to the right. Step to the front with the left foot, the left hand grasping
the thighs just above the knee as the foot comes to the ground, the right arm
extended in the line of the right leg. Next seize the bell with the right hand,
keeping the lower limbs in position. Now lift the bell above the shoulder to the
full extension of the arm, leaning strongly on the left knee and pressing the breast
to the front during the ascent of the bell, the lower limbs to the knee, and the left
arm forming a continuous line from foot to shoulder. Lower the bell, replace it,
and recover. Then upright again, step to the rear, right half turn, step to the front
with the right foot, and go through the same motions exactly, only with the other

<p>In number fifteen lay the bells at the toes, then stoop and recover them to the
hang, then charge out, as it were, with the right foot, taking a good long step, and
throwing out your arm to its full length as you do so (<a href="#FigIII09">Fig. 9</a>). Keep your left leg
straight and your shoulders back, and double up your extended arm so as to bring
the bell to the top of your shoulder. Move the bell backwards and forwards
ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
times, and at each return sink towards the ground, bending as you straighten your
arm. Then move as in <a href="#FigIII17">Fig. 17</a>. Then recover, strike out with the left leg and
arm, and repeat all the motions (<a href="#FigIII18">Fig. 18</a>). In sixteen go through the same
preliminaries, but instead of striking the hands straight out strike them aloft,
sinking as the arm is extended (<a href="#FigIII10">Fig. 10</a>).</p>

down. Keep the finger in front of the handle all through this exercise; do not
twist the bells as they pass to the rear. In number nineteen (<a href="#FigIII11">Fig. 11</a>) swing to the
front, then to the back at extension, then from extension swing overhead till the
bells meet, then bring them down to the chest and so to the hang, five motions in
all. Then step forward with the left foot and go through the same five motions.
Then with the right foot advanced go through the same five motions. The object
of all these exercises is, of course, to bring into play as many muscles as possible,
giving each a turn in time. Whenever possible an exercise should always be done

with bells at the side, bring them up to armpits and aloft, and holding them high in
the air together twist your body round to the left as far as it will go, but do not
move your legs. Then bring the bells to the chest and lift them
simultaneously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and alternately thirty times as before, then turn your body to the right and do
likewise. In twenty-one bring the bells to the chest, twist the body and strike out
straight with them together and separately, first twisting to the left, then right.
In twenty-two (<a href="#FigIII14">Fig. 14</a>) raise the bells overhead and sink to the floor, and with
knees bent go through the ten first strokes. Then rise and down again and do
the ten strokes with the left; then up and down again for the ten with the right.</p>

<p>In twenty-three, as the body sinks the bells are brought to the chest and the
arms are extended, moving round to the front horizontally, and brought to the
chest again, much as in the act of rowing. This is a very tiring exercise, and at
first makes itself felt in every joint in the body: ten times together is quite enough
for the first day&#8217;s work. Twenty-four (<a href="#FigIII16">Fig. 16</a>) is an easy exercise, but a valuable
one. Swing the bells aloft, and then bend backwards, letting the arms slowly open
and extend backwards towards the ground; then bring them back aloft from behind
without bending them, then bend in front, and lay the bells at your toes.</p>

<p>There are other exercises, but they are all, like many we have given, mere
combinations easily invented by the proficient. The examples herein are quite
enough to bring out the full powers of the dumbbell as a gymnastic appliance, and
a steady practice of them for ten minutes a day after the morning tub, will not only
set the student well up and shape him properly, but add an inch or so to his girth

<h3>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;JUGGLING WITH BALLS.<br />
<span class="smcap">By a Practical Gymnast.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">Juggling with balls, a pastime as pretty as it is entertaining, has also certain
special advantages. In the first place, it is really an art, well worthy of the name,
which may be easily acquired by members of either sex at any age, and it affords a
gentle exercise which is extremely beneficial to the health.</p>

<p>In illustration of this, I may mention a fact which, some years ago, came under
my personal notice. An artist friend of mine, finding that his health was giving
way under the toil and the strain it was necessary for him to devote to his
profession, asked me if I could recommend him some not too laborious exercise to
which he might betake himself in the brief intervals of his work. Clubs and dumb-bells
were too heavy, he said, and their use moreover rendered his hand unsteady,
and so prevented his putting into his picture those delicate touches so necessary
for success.</p>

<p>I suggested juggling with balls, as being an exercise less violent and equally
healthy. He sprang at the idea, and after giving him some instructions I left him,
and soon forgot all about the circumstance.</p>

<p>Several months afterwards I called on my friend at his studio, and, to my
surprise and amusement, found him busy&mdash;not with his pencil, but with three
juggling balls. &#8216;I&#8217;ve done it,&#8217; he cried with great glee, as soon as he saw me;
&#8216;I can shower three! Look!&#8217; And thereupon he recommenced his operations,
and soon convinced me that he had become an adept at his new pursuit; and he
really seemed to be more pleased to have succeeded with the &#8216;shower&#8217; than with
his picture, which was shortly afterwards exhibited &#8216;on the line&#8217; at the Royal
Academy. That he was in good spirits you will have gathered from what I have
just said, and you will readily believe that he could hardly have been so happy
unless his health had been re-established.</p>

<p>Nor is the juggling with balls simply a healthy exercise. It <i>must</i> lead to useful,
and it may (and often does) lead to very important results. The quickness of hand
and eye acquired by the practice is not only valuable in cricket, football, and other
sports, but also can hardly fail to prove serviceable in the sterner duties and
emergencies of life. If space permitted I could relate many stories of articles, and
even life, being saved by the dexterous catch of one who had practised juggling. I
am generally called upon, when in a gymnasium, to stand close to any one who is
about to try a new exercise, or one attended with risk, either on the horizontal or
trapeze bar, in case of a slip; and I entirely attribute my quickness in catching to
my proficiency in juggling, the hand being taught instantly to follow any movement
the eye may detect.</p>

<p>This subject, useful as I have shown it to be, has, so far as I am aware, never
been treated on in any English publication, although in France and in many other
parts of the Continent juggling forms an important branch of physical education,
and is much practised in the gymnasia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>You may very naturally suppose that it is almost impossible to teach anything
of this kind on paper, but it must not be forgotten that in this, as in everything else
in life, to ensure success it is necessary to make a good beginning. There is no
royal road to learning, and unless a proper foundation be laid the castle will prove
to be but visionary. So even on paper I can give you many valuable hints and
much practical advice, without attention to which you will never become adepts in
the art. You must not suppose, however, that I can make practised jugglers of you
in a few lessons, nor must you be too anxious to play two or three balls before you
have a perfect command over number one.</p>

<p>The first object to be aimed at is to procure the best sort of balls for your
purpose. Of course, anything in the shape of a ball will <i>do</i>&mdash;oranges, for instance,
tennis or raquet-balls, etc.&mdash;but the best are made of hollow brass, two inches in
diameter, and these may be obtained at from ten to twelve shillings per set of four.
They are made specially for the purpose, their hollowness giving them a lightness
which a solid substance obviously cannot possess. It is indispensable that the
balls should all be exactly the same weight, otherwise in the rapid passes&mdash;such as
the &#8216;<a href="#Ref11">shower</a>&#8217; or &#8216;<a href="#Ref12">fountain</a>,&#8217;
about to be described&mdash;the lighter would be thrown
farther than the heavier, and the most skilful performer would fail to accomplish
the feat.</p>

<p>Being satisfied with regard to the balls, we will now proceed to the First
Practice, viz.,</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Vertical Fall</span> (<a href="#FigIV01"><i>Fig.</i> 1</a>),</h4>

<p class="noindent">that is, to throw a ball into the air so that it will descend to the exact point from
which it was projected. You will find, at first, that when you have thrown the ball
up into the air it will not drop back again into your hand, but you will have to
follow its course in order to catch it. The first point to be gained, then, is to
throw the ball so that it will drop into the hand which is ready to receive it, and
this must be practised with both hands, as the left will have quite as much to do
as the right. When you have thoroughly mastered this art, and can catch a ball
with decision when thrown from three to four feet in height, you may proceed to
the Second Practice, which is called&mdash;</p>

</div>

</div><!--figc400-->

<h4><span class="smcap">The Inside and Outside Falls</span> (<a href="#FigIV02"><i>Fig.</i> 2</a>).</h4>

<p>What is required now is to throw the ball with the right hand so that it will
describe a curve in the air and drop towards the left hand, as shown in <a href="#FigIV02">Fig. 2</a>; but,
instead of catching it with the left, it must be caught with the right. This is the
Inside Fall. Now throw the ball back in a similar way from left to right. This is
called the Outside Fall. This, of course, sounds easy enough, as it is merely
playing at catch-ball, but you will find it very difficult at first to throw the ball
several times in succession without deviating from the same course, and this course
is of the utmost importance, as, when you are playing two or three balls, unless
they follow one another in the same course, the whole play will immediately
become inextricable confusion, and they will all fall to the ground. Do not
attempt at first to throw the ball higher than three feet, which, indeed, is the height
generally required. When you are perfect with the right hand, practise the same
play-motion with the left. Let me again impress upon you the necessity, if you
would attain proficiency in the art, of using the left hand as much as the right in
all these exercises. Without this success is impossible. We now come to the
Third Practice, or&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Parallel Fall</span> (<a href="#FigIV03"><i>Fig.</i> 3</a>).</h4>

<p>This will be found rather more difficult than either of the former, because in
this the arm, as well as the hand, will be constantly in motion. Throw the ball
with the right hand, as in the Vertical Fall, keeping the hand in a line with the
right shoulder. The moment it is caught, bring the right hand in a line with the
left shoulder, throw the ball from that position and catch it, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Afterwards
do the same with the left hand. <a href="#FigIV03">Fig. 3</a> will show you the practice, the
dotted lines representing the movements the ball should take. All these necessary,
if somewhat tedious, rudiments of the science having been mastered, we will proceed
to the Fourth Practice.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 4</p>
</div>

</div><!--figc600-->

<h4><span class="smcap">The Outside and Inside Fall from Right Hand to Left.</span></h4>

<p>In this exercise both hands are brought into play. The motion of the ball is
precisely the same as in <a href="#FigIV02">Fig. 2</a>, but, instead of catching it with the same hand,
you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
must now pass it from one hand to the other. Practise this at first with the hands
a very little distance apart, and do not throw the ball too high. As you improve,
gradually increase the height, and move your hands away until they are about three
feet distant from each other. Up to this time the ball has been forming a kind of
hyperbole or arch in its course. Now, without altering the position of the hands,
cause the ball gradually to lower its course until it is thrown in the Fifth Practice,
which is called&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Horizontal Pass.</span></h4>

<div class="figc550">

<div class="figleft" id="FigIV05">

<p class="caption">Fig. 6</p>
</div>

</div><!--figc550-->

<p>This you will find quick work alike for eyes and hands, for, of course, the ball
cannot be made to pass in a straight line from one hand to the other without giving
it increased impetus and a considerable accession of speed. Gradually move your
hands, at first closer to one another, and then farther apart. In fact, continue this
exercise until your hands are as distant from each other as you can reach. This
will be found excellent practice for the &#8216;<a href="#Ref11">shower</a>&#8217; at which we shall soon arrive.
The Sixth Practice is</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Double Vertical Fall</span></h4>

<p class="noindent">(as shown in <a href="#FigIV06">Fig. 6</a>). You will now take a ball in each hand, and commence by
throwing that in the right hand vertically (as in <a href="#FigIV01">Fig. 1</a>), then that in the left in the
same manner, alternately. Before the first ball has descended into the right hand,
throw the second into the air with the left, so that the two balls shall be constantly
in motion. You will now find the advantage of being proficient in the single
vertical fall, as otherwise, your attention being distracted from the one ball to the
other, you would probably not be able to catch either. Now practise throwing
both balls up together, keeping your hands about two feet apart, and taking care
that neither ball goes higher than the other. As the last practice was good for the
&#8216;shower&#8217; so you will see that the present will prepare you for the &#8216;<a href="#Ref12">fountain</a>,&#8217; the
description of which will follow in due course. The Seventh Practice is termed</p>

<h4 id="Ref13"><span class="smcap">The Double Inside Fall.</span></h4>

<p>This is a repetition of the Outside and Inside Fall, but is performed with two
balls at the same time and with both hands. In this exercise great care must
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
taken to avoid a collision of the balls when they are in the act of passing. To
ensure against such a calamity it is necessary that one ball&mdash;generally that from the
right hand&mdash;should be projected slightly higher than the other (as in <a href="#FigIV07">Fig. 7</a>). This
should be practised at various heights until something like perfect accuracy is
arrived at, as all the following practices are founded, more or less, upon this very
important exercise.</p>

</div>

</div><!--figc600-->

<p>The Eighth Practice is entitled</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Triple Pass</span>,</h4>

<p class="noindent">which must not be attempted until you have made perfect the last <a href="#Ref13">exercise</a>. On
referring to <a href="#FigIV08">Fig. 8</a>, you will see that this practice is nothing more than a repetition
of the last, with the addition of a third ball. This third ball, however, will seem to
you at first to be quite an interloper, and the greatest care must be taken in
throwing all the balls regularly, otherwise they will go into a &#8216;confusion worse
confounded.&#8217; The eyes and the hands, however, being by this time pretty well
trained, increased vigilance in the former and increased agility in the latter are all
that is required to enable you to master the increased difficulty of the performance.
The dotted lines indicate the proper direction in which the balls should be
thrown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
showing how each ball should cross the course of the others without any of them
coming into collision. We proceed at once to the Ninth Practice, which is called</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Triple Over and Under Pass.</span></h4>

<p>This play is almost similar to the last, differing only in this&mdash;that, instead of
the balls following each the course of the other, they are returned from the left to
the right by the course indicated in the dotted lines in <a href="#FigIV08">Fig. 8</a>, forming an inner fall
while the others are passing over them. The effect of the change is very pretty,
and though it will perhaps be found somewhat more difficult, you are now becoming
so skilful that difficulties will no doubt serve only to stimulate you to fresh exertion.
The Tenth Practice is</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Single Over and Double Under Pass.</span></h4>

<p>This is another variation of the same play, in which the over ball is kept
outside, whilst the under two are performing a double pass. In this practice you
must keep the outside single ball well above the two that are passing underneath,
as shown in the dotted lines in <a href="#FigIV10">Fig. 10</a>. Care must be taken, in this as in
every other practice, to avoid collision between the balls. Practice, we know,
makes perfect, and nothing but patient perseverance can be recommended to
ensure success.</p>

<p>The Eleventh Practice brings us to one of the neatest, prettiest, and most
effective feats in ball juggling. It is called</p>

<h4 id="Ref11"><span class="smcap">The Shower.</span></h4>

<p>This, undoubtedly one of the most fascinating of all juggling feats, is an art
easily acquired by so practised a juggler as you have now become. Take two balls,
one in each hand, throw the one in the right hand into the air towards the left, as
in <a href="#FigIV04">Fig. 4</a>, and while it is in the air, &#8216;pass&#8217; the left-hand ball to the right hand, as
in <a href="#FigIV05">Fig. 5</a>, and immediately throw it to follow the course of the first, continuing this
play as quickly as possible, so that there may be one ball always in the air. You
will find very little difficulty in showering two balls in this manner with one hand, as
it is really nothing more than a Double Inside Fall (<a href="#FigIV02">Fig. 2</a>); in fact, some expert
jugglers can shower three balls with one hand, but this is a very difficult feat, and
the balls have to be thrown very high. You can make the attempt if you
please,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
but I do not wish to enter upon matters which may confuse and possibly dishearten
you, and will ask you therefore to perfect yourselves in this feat before proceeding
to the Twelfth Practice, viz.,</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Triple Shower</span>,</h4>

<p class="noindent">which is accomplished in the following manner. Take two balls in the right hand
and one in the left. Throw one after the other in very quick succession in the
direction of the Inside Fall (<a href="#FigIV02">Fig. 2</a>) with the right hand, and as each reaches the
left hand, &#8216;pass&#8217; it from the left to the right, as shown in
<a href="#FigIV11">Figs. 11</a> and <a href="#FigIV12">12</a>, and
continue the Shower as long as you please. From the swiftness of their motion,
the balls appear to multiply, and your audience will almost be inclined to believe
that you are playing with fifty balls, instead of with only three. When you are
very expert in this you can proceed to the Thirteenth Practice,</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Quadruple Shower</span>,</h4>

<p class="noindent">or Grand Shower, as it is sometimes called. This is the same play as the last but
with four balls, three of which must be held in the right and one in the left hand.
It is hardly necessary to say that the difficulty is greatly increased, as the balls must
be thrown much higher, so that there may be more space between them in order to
allow time for the rapid passes. In all the Showers, but in this especially, it is
advisable to keep the right hand a little higher than the left, as shown in <a href="#FigIV13">Fig. 13</a>.
The Fourteenth Practice, which is the last of the present series, is</p>

<h4 id="Ref12"><span class="smcap">The Fountain.</span></h4>

</div><!--figc540-->

<p>This is the most difficult feat of all, as so much depends upon the precision with
which the balls are delivered. Commence practising with two balls, and perform a
Double Outside Fall with both hands (<a href="#FigIV14">Fig. 14</a>). You will find this sharp work for
the eyes, as you will have to be looking at two places simultaneously as the balls
descend. When you can play two balls well in this manner, you will find that</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Double Fountain</span>,</h4>

<p class="noindent">as described in <a href="#FigIV15">Fig. 15</a>,
will not be difficult, as it is done in a &#8216;swing,&#8217; as it is
called, a motion of the body and arms which it is not possible to describe,
but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
which will come naturally to you as you acquire the art of juggling. The Fountain
may be varied by a motion which is known as</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Double Fountain Change.</span></h4>

<p>Instead of throwing up the balls together, present them alternately, as shown in
<a href="#FigIV16">Fig. 16</a>. This has a very pretty effect, and exactly represents the name given it.</p>

<p>Having now given you all the instruction in my power, it only remains for me to
make one or two suggestions which I think will commend themselves to your
intelligence. In the first place, I would advise you to practise over some soft
material, on the lawn if possible, where the dropping of the balls can annoy no one;
but if a lawn be not available, then over a sofa, or a bed, or a very soft rug or mat.
You are certain to have many a mishap at starting, and I can conceive nothing in a
small way more irritating than for a person seated in a room to be perpetually
startled by the noise of balls falling overhead. Finally, let me impress upon you
the fact that your success depends entirely upon yourselves. The teacher may
show <i>how</i> the thing is to be done, but it is for the pupil to do it. Remember that
&#8216;whatever is worth doing is worth doing well,&#8217; and if you think it worth your
while to learn the art of juggling, you must devote to it patience, perseverance, and
practice. Without these you will never succeed. With them success is certain.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.&mdash;SOME SIMPLE MODELS FOR BEGINNERS.</h3>

<h4>I. <span class="smcap">How to make a Boat with a Screw Propeller.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">By F. Chasemore.</span></h4>

<p class="noindent">To make a model steamboat that will go is the ambition of most boys, but the
high price of engine and boiler deters many from doing so. In this chapter instructions
are given for making a model screw steamboat, the machinery for which
every boy can make for himself, by the exercise of a little ingenuity, at a very trifling
cost&mdash;which machinery, too, may be fitted into any boat, the rigging of which may
have gone by the board off the dangerous coast of the duck-pond.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigV01">
<img src="images/illo079.png" alt="model boat" width="600" height="245" />
<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 1</i></p>
</div>

<p>First you must procure your boat; but if you should wish to make the boat
yourself you will need no instructions from me, as several capital chapters on <a href="#Ref14">boat-building</a>
appear in another part of this volume. The only directions I need
give are, that your craft shall be very light, and hollowed out as thin as possible, be
twenty-four inches long, four inches wide at midships, and three and a half inches
deep; the sternpost to be about an inch and a half within the stern, to be raking,
and two and a half inches high, as marked in <a href="#FigV01">Fig. 1</a>; a strip of lead one-eighth of
an inch thick to be fastened along the bottom of the keel; the bows to be sharp,
and the boat to have a clean run aft. When the boat is finished paint it, and when
dry put it into water, and mark on the sternpost the height the water comes. Now
you must bore a hole in the sternpost right through into the boat, in the direction
of the top of the stem. This must be done with a red-hot wire; the hole is to be
three-eighths of an inch across.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigV02">
<img src="images/illo080a.png" alt="tube" width="300" height="65" />
<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 2</i></p>
</div>

<p>The next thing to do is to get a brass tube from the gasfitter&#8217;s, or get a tinman to
make you one of tin three-eighths of an inch inside measurement. This tube must
be long enough to reach from the sternpost to three and a half inches beyond the
top of the stem. Four inches from one end of this tube solder a strip half an
inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
wide and one and three-quarter inches along, bending the middle of it half round
the tube, and bending the ends outwards; punch a hole in each end of this strip;
in this end of the tube cut four teeth like saw-teeth, one-eighth of an inch deep, like
<a href="#FigV02">Fig. 2</a>. Put this tube in the boat thus. Push the end, without the tin strip, through
the hole in the sternpost from the inside of the boat, so that the tube is flush with
the wood, and fasten the other end by driving tacks through the holes in the tin
strip into the boat. Put some putty round the tube where it goes through the wood,
to keep the water out. Now make the deck of board one-eighth of an inch thick,
plane it, and fix it in its place by pins, leaving a gunwale of half an inch all round.
Stop up with putty, and mark with a pencil the boards on the deck. Bore a hole
near the stern one-sixteenth of an inch wide right through the deck and boat,
coming out under the counter one inch from the sternpost. This is the rudder-hole.
To make the rudder get a piece of brass wire one-sixteenth of an inch in diameter,
and six inches long; cut your rudder out of tin, and solder it on to the wire, so
that the heel of the rudder is flush with one end of the wire. Now push the other
end up through the hole in the counter, and bend it down on to the deck; this will
form the tiller, and, by pressing tightly on to the deck, will keep the rudder firm
and in its place for steering.</p>

<p>Two inches abaft the middle of the deck cut a hole three-quarters of an inch in
diameter for the chimney, which is a tube of tin three-quarters of an inch in diameter
and four inches long. Bore two more holes in the deck three-eighths of an inch in
diameter, one halfway between the stem and chimney, the other halfway between
the rudder and chimney; these are for the masts, which are made of wood, and
should stand about nine inches above deck; put a pin into the end of each
mast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and cut the head off, leaving about half an inch of the pin projecting; put the
masts in their places, and the pins will keep them firm by being pushed into the
bottom of the boat.</p>

<img src="images/illo080d.png" alt="power handle" width="324" height="114" />
<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 5</i></p>
</div>

<p>Make the propeller out of a circular piece of stout tin two inches in diameter,
cut as in <a href="#FigV03">Fig. 3</a>. The dark parts are to be cut away. The projections are to be
three-quarters of an inch long. Punch a hole one-sixteenth of an inch in the centre,
and fix a piece of brass wire one-sixteenth of an inch, two inches long, in the hole,
to form an axle for the propeller. Twist each of the fans of the screw out of the
plane of the circle about a quarter of an inch, in the manner of the sails of a
windmill, as in <a href="#FigV04">Fig. 4</a>. Now make two little wooden plugs three-quarters of an
inch long, and half an inch wide at one end, tapering to a quarter of an inch at the
other. Bore a hole through each from end to end one-sixteenth of an inch wide.
Take the propeller, and put a glass bead, that will fit easily, on the wire, and push
the wire through one of the wooden plugs from the large end; bend the wire into a
loop at the small end. Next take another piece of wire, two and a half inches long,
and make a similar loop at one end, and put the other end through the other little
plug, from the small end, and bend the wire into a handle (<a href="#FigV05">Fig. 5</a>). Now the only
thing we want is the power. This is a strip of strong elastic about three and a half
feet long and a quarter of an inch wide; tie the ends together to make a band&mdash;a
large stout elastic ring will do, or two smaller rings looped together. Fasten a string
to the elastic, and pass the string through the tube in the boat, from the stern end;
hook the loop on the propeller-wire into the elastic, and push the wooden plug into
the tube so that the screw is clear of the rudder; draw the elastic, by the string,
through the other end of the tube, and hook the wire in the other plug into it;
take off the string and push the plug into its place. You must cut the plug away
so that the handle can catch in the teeth cut in the tube. Now the boat is
ready for use.</p>

<p>To use it wind up the elastic by the handle at the end of the tube, holding the
screw firmly with the other hand. As soon as wound up enough set the rudder and
put the boat into the water; release the screw, and the boat will go till the elastic
is quite unwound. The distance it will travel will be regulated by the extent to
which the elastic is wound up.</p>

<h4>II. <span class="smcap">How to make a small Marine Engine for a Boat four or five ft. long.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">By Frank Chasemore.</span></h4>

<p>I have already described the method of making a small boat move through the
water by means of an elastic band, which is simply twisted up and then released, but
I have no doubt that many readers would like to possess a simple model boat to
work by steam.</p>

<p>Such models can now be purchased at all shops where mechanical toys are sold,
at prices varying from one shilling, the smallest, eight inches in length, to about
twenty pounds, the largest, five feet in length. Although all these boats really go
by steam, the application of the power is different in the different sizes.</p>

<p>The small boats are of course the simplest. In these the steam from the boiler
is conducted through a short pipe to the sternpost of the boat, where by its
pressure on the water in escaping it forces the boat along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The next class have a further development of the application of steam-power.
In the centre of the boat, close behind the boiler, is a fan-wheel, turning on an
axle, which in the case of a paddle-boat carries the paddles, and in the case of
a screw carries the propeller. The steam is conducted from the boiler through a
short pipe to the front of the fan-wheel, which it blows round as it escapes.</p>

<p>The third class are the steamboats proper, varying in price from five shillings
upwards. In these the steam-power is applied as in ordinary engines. The
cheapest have one single-action oscillating cylinder, and the better sorts two double-action
cylinders.</p>

<p>As the two first-mentioned classes are, after all, only imitations, I do not think
it worth while to describe them; and of the third class I have chosen the largest to
describe, as I think that if it is worth while making a model at all, it is worth while
to make a good one, and the small engines take almost as much time to make, and
quite as much care to fit, as the large ones, and unless they are well fitted the loss
of power by friction and waste of steam is very great.</p>

<p>The engine here described is a model of a real screw-engine, with a pair of
double-action oscillating cylinders, having reversing gear and boiler complete, ready
to be put into the boat. It will be capable of driving a boat from four to five feet
long, provided it is well hollowed out and that the engine is made and fitted with
care, to reduce friction and waste of steam as much as possible.</p>

<p>In this section the exact dimensions of the several parts are given when
possible, but, owing to small differences in the size of the cylinders, I am only able
to approximate in some cases&mdash;in which cases, however, I have used the word
&#8216;about,&#8217; at the same time explaining how to obtain the exact measurements.</p>

<p>In all engines the most important parts are the cylinders, which must be well
fitted. Boys who have a turning-lathe and the requisite practice in metal-turning
can buy rough castings of all the parts of the engine for a few shillings and finish
them up themselves. But as only a few of my readers may be so favoured, I will
suppose that the cylinders are purchased ready for use. For these cylinders there
is a great range in the prices quoted by different firms, the prices varying for the
No. 4 cylinder from eight shillings at one firm to twelve shillings and sixpence at
another. Messrs. Theobald and Co., of 20, Church Street, Kensington, quote the
lowest prices to me, and have further consented to supply the No. 4 double-action
oscillating cylinders for this engine at seven shillings each to any one mentioning
this section.</p>

<p>The dimensions of these cylinders are three quarters of an inch in the diameter
of the bore, and an inch and a half in the length of stroke&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, an inch and a
half difference in the length the piston-rod projects from the top of the cylinder
when in and out to its fullest.</p>

<p>Get a pair of these cylinders which have the steam-blocks, pivot-pillars, and
screw-crossheads complete. Ask for the No. 4 double-action oscillating cylinders.
When buying them see that the piston-rods work true, and not to one side; see
also that the small indentations on the opposite sides to the steam ports are
correctly drilled, so that when the cylinders are swung between the blocks and
pivots they work true. To test this, place the block on its back on the table, and
put the cylinder on it, with the pivot in the proper hole for it. Now turn
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
cylinder round on the block and place a pin in the indentation, and if it is truly
drilled the pin will not move; but if not, the point of the pin will describe a small
circle. You can find out by this pin the exact spot where the pivot-hole ought to
be drilled.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigV01a">
<img src="images/illo083.png" alt="top plate" width="600" height="360" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1</p>
</div>

<p>We will now set to work at the construction of the engine, and the first thing to
be done is to make the top plate (<a href="#FigV01a">Fig. 1</a>). For this get a small brass plate four
inches long and three inches wide, and an eighth of an inch thick, with a projecting
piece an inch and a quarter square at one end of it, as in the <a href="#FigV01a">figure</a>. Get two of
these plates, as the second will be required for the bed-plate, but will not have the
square projecting piece. Take the first of these plates and square it up, so that
each corner is a right angle. Now proceed to mark it as in <a href="#FigV01a">Fig. 1</a>. Divide the
large part lengthwise into two equal parts by the line <span class="smcapall">C D</span>, and crosswise, also into
two equal parts by the line <span class="smcapall">A B</span>, these two lines
intersecting in the point <span class="smcapall">O</span>. From
this point mark off, each way along the lines <span class="smcapall">O C</span> and
<span class="smcapall">O D</span>, the following distances.
<span class="smcapall">O</span> to <i>x</i> a quarter of an inch, and <i>x</i> to <i>y</i> an inch and a quarter; and through these
four points draw the lines <i>e-g</i>, <i>f-h</i>, <i>k-m</i>, and <i>l-n</i>, making them two inches
long each, and projecting one inch on each side of the line <span class="smcapall">C D</span>. Join the points
<i>e-f</i>, <i>g-h</i>, <i>k-l</i>, and <i>m-n</i>.</p>

<p>Cut out the two rectangles so formed carefully, so as not to injure the lines.
This can be done easily by first drilling a small hole, about an eighth of an inch in
diameter, near one corner, and then putting a fretwork saw through it and fixing it
in the frame, and sawing the metal away just inside the lines. The saw must be
kept well moistened with water. The corners can be left circular, which will add
to the finish of the plate, and make the cutting with the saw easier.</p>

<p>After the holes are cut they must be finished quite up to the lines, but without
injuring them, with a fine-cut flat file. Through each corner of the plate a hole
must be drilled an eighth of an inch in diameter, and about an eighth of an
inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
from the edges, as in <a href="#FigV01a">Fig. 1</a>. The top plate is now ready for mounting the cylinders
on, which we will set about doing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigV02a">
<img src="images/illo084a.png" alt="steam-block" width="300" height="195" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2</p>
</div>

<p>Take the two steam-blocks (<a href="#FigV02a">Fig. 2</a>) and draw a pencil mark on each from the
centre hole to the bottom, and at right angles to it (<a href="#FigV02a">Fig. 2</a>). Next place the two
blocks back to back on the middle of the top plate, between the two large holes, so
that the pencil marks coincide with the line <span class="smcapall">C D</span>, and so that the bottom edges of
the faces coincide with the lines <i>f-h</i> and <i>k-m</i>. Be very careful in setting these
blocks right. When in their places mark the top plate through the screw-holes in
the projecting bases of each, and drill four holes straight down through the plate,
making them a little smaller than the holes in the bases of the blocks. Now replace
the blocks and fasten them there with two small screws each. These screws
correspond with the size of the cylinders, and can be purchased by the dozen,
together with taps, for each size, to make the thread in the holes with.</p>

<p>Next take the pivot-blocks and mark them with pencil, as the steam-blocks were
marked, and put them on the line <span class="smcapall">C D</span> on the outer sides of the large holes, using
the same care to get them properly centred along the line <span class="smcapall">C D</span>, and at right angles
to it, and about an eighth of an inch from the lines <i>e-g</i> and <i>l-n</i>. Mark the
screw-holes and drill them as before, and fasten the pillars in their places.</p>

<p>Now the cylinders can be hung. Unscrew the pivots about a quarter of an inch
and place the cylinders in their places, with the spindles in the proper holes for
them in the blocks. Now screw in the wire pivots till they catch in the indentations
drilled for them in the sides of the cylinders. They will now swing freely between
the blocks and pivots.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigV03a">
<img src="images/illo084b.png" alt="bed-plate" width="500" height="362" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3</p>
</div>

<p>Now to cut the bed-plate (<a href="#FigV03a">Fig. 3</a>). Take your second brass plate and divide it
by the lines <span class="smcapall">A B</span> and <span class="smcapall">C D</span>
as before. From the point <span class="smcapall">O</span> mark off each way along the
line <span class="smcapall">C D</span> the distances five-eighths of an inch from
<span class="smcapall">O</span> to <i>x</i>, and three-quarters of an
inch from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i>. Through these points draw four lines two inches long,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
projecting one inch on each side of the line <span class="smcapall">C D</span>, and
parallel to the line <span class="smcapall">A B</span>. Join
the lines in pairs as before, and cut out the rectangles so formed. Finish up the
edges, and bore a hole in each corner, as in the top plate. On the line <span class="smcapall">A B</span>, and
half an inch from each end, bore two holes an eighth of an inch in diameter, and
countersink them at the top, as in the <a href="#FigV03a">figure</a>.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Now the bearings for the crank-shaft must be made. <a href="#FigV04a">Fig. 4</a> is a perspective
view of one of these. Get two pieces of brass one inch long, half an inch wide, and
a quarter of an inch thick, as <a href="#FigV05a">Fig. 5</a>. Along the face of each block draw a line,
dividing it lengthwise into two equal parts, and in the centre of these lines drill a
hole right through the brass one-eighth of an inch in diameter. Cut the brass away
at the ends (as in <a href="#FigV04a">Figs. 4</a> and <a href="#FigV05a">5</a>), leaving the projecting pieces a quarter of an inch
long and a little more than one-sixteenth of an inch thick. Through each of these
flanges drill a hole, to screw the bearings to the bed-plate by. Drill two holes down
through the top of the block, passing one on each side of the bearing-hole (as in
<a href="#FigV05a">Fig. 5</a>, the dotted lines showing the positions of the holes). Drill a small hole
through the top of the cap into the bearing-hole, for oiling purposes. Cut the block
in two along the line passing through the middle of the bearing-hole with a stiff-backed
saw. This will make the block as in <a href="#FigV06a">Fig. 6</a>, having a movable cap which
can be fastened in its place with two screws. Screw these bearing-blocks in their
places, one at each end of the bed-plate, using the same care to get them properly
centred along the line <span class="smcapall">C D</span> and at right angles to it.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 8</p>
</div>

</div><!--figc540-->

<p>We must now make the crank-shaft. This can be made with bent wire one-eighth
of an inch thick. But when made in this way it very seldom works steadily
and true. The best way is to build it up. You must get a piece of iron wire a
quarter of an inch in diameter and about two feet long. Part of this will be required
for the screw-shaft; straighten and smooth the wire and polish it up. Cut from the
end three pieces, one an inch long, the second two inches long, and the third one
and seven-eighths of an inch long. Next get four pieces of flat iron plate one-eighth
of an inch thick, one inch long, and half an inch wide. Cut them into the shape
shown in <a href="#FigV07a">Fig. 7</a>. The distance between the centres of the holes is to be a little less
than three-quarters of an inch. The largest hole is one-eighth of an inch square,
and the smallest hole a little less. The metal is to be left one-eighth of an inch
wide round the holes. Take the shortest piece of iron wire and cut one end of it
away, leaving a square pin and shoulder; the pin is to be three-sixteenths of an inch
long, and one-eighth of an inch square (<a href="#FigV08a">Fig. 8</a>). Cut both ends of the two-inch
piece and one end of the remaining piece in the same way. Counter-sink the largest
holes in the plates (<a href="#FigV07a">Fig. 7</a>) and rivet them on the pins of the portions of the shaft,
being careful that they are at right angles to the rods. The plates on the
two-inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
piece must be at right angles to each other. The pins should fit very tightly in the
holes, to make them firm when riveted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigV09a">
<img src="images/illo086a.png" alt="crank-shaft" width="600" height="149" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 9</p>
</div>

<p>Cut two pieces of iron wire one-eighth of an inch in diameter and five-eighths of
an inch long, and at each end of each piece make a pin and shoulder to fit the small
holes in the plates, leaving a full quarter of an inch of the wire between the pins
untouched. Join the cranks together in pairs by riveting in these wires, being
careful to keep the cranks at right angles to the shaft, and also to keep the several
pieces of the shaft in the same straight line. Place the shaft on the bearing-blocks
in the position it will occupy, with the cranks over the holes in the bed-plate and
with the longest end to the after end of it. Mark on the shaft the position and
thickness of the bearing-blocks, and cut the metal of the rods away in these places
till it is reduced to one-eighth of an inch in thickness, so that it will work freely in
the bearing-holes. The crank will now look like <a href="#FigV09a">Fig. 9</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigV10">
<img src="images/illo086b.png" alt="design" width="600" height="35" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 10</p>
</div>

<p>The next step is to connect the top and bed-plates by four pillars. The length
of these will depend on the length of the piston-rod. They must be made of four
pieces of brass wire a quarter of an inch thick. Take one of the cylinders and a
sheet of paper; on this paper draw a line about six inches long, and at one end
mark the point <span class="smcapall">A</span> (<a href="#FigV10">Fig. 10</a>).
Push the piston-rod in as far as it will go, and push the
pivot of the cylinder through the point <span class="smcapall">A</span>, and mark
on the line the point <span class="smcapall">B</span>, exactly
under the hole in the crosshead of the piston-rod. Now draw out the piston-rod as
far as it will go, and mark the point <span class="smcapall">C</span> exactly under the hole as before. Bisect the
portion of the line between <span class="smcapall">B C</span> in the point
<span class="smcapall">D</span>, and measure the distance between <span class="smcapall">A</span>
and <span class="smcapall">D</span>. Reduce this length by the distance the centre hole in the steam-blocks is
from the lower edge, and add to it a quarter of an inch for the height of the centre
of the bearing-block from the upper surface of the bed-plates, one-eighth of an inch
for the thickness of the bed-plate, and a quarter of an inch for riveting.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigV11">
<img src="images/illo086c.png" alt="pillar" width="350" height="35" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 11</p>
</div>

<p>This will give you the length of the pillars including the pins. File a pin and
shoulder at each end, as in <a href="#FigV11">Fig. 11</a>, making the pins one-eighth of an inch in
diameter and a quarter of an inch long. Rivet a pillar firmly in each corner hole of
the bed-plate, and put the top plate on the top ends of the pillars, and rivet them
firmly in. Be careful that the pillars are upright. Rehang the cylinders and
unscrew the caps of the crossheads. Fit the cranks into the holes in them and
screw on the caps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>If the cylinders are made without screw-crossheads the pin of the cranks must
be placed through the hole in the heads before riveting the cranks together.
Unscrew the caps of the bearing-blocks, and put the crank-shaft into the bearing-holes,
and screw on the caps again. Oil all bearings and parts that work together.
Now you must get a heavy brass fly-wheel three inches in diameter, which can be
purchased with the other things, and costs about two shillings. This wheel has a
screw-bolt through one side of the centre block to fix it to the shaft by. Fix this
wheel on the long end of the shaft by tightening the screw. It would be better to
make a small hole in the shaft for the point of the screw to enter. The wheel must
have two iron pins, about one inch long, in the face of it.</p>

<p>Now if all the fittings are well made and oiled, the engine ought to work easily
and smoothly without noise if the fly-wheel is spun round.</p>

<p><a href="#FigV26">Fig. 26</a> at the end of this section represents the engine as finished.</p>

<p>We must now turn our attention to the boiler. For this you must obtain
some sheet copper; get the size known as 12-lb. copper&mdash;that is, the sheet two
feet by eight feet weighs 12 lb. You must also procure some copper tubing
one-third of an inch in diameter. Get also the following articles; two brass
gauge-taps, 1s. 3d. each; one steam-tap with union, 1s. 6d.; man-hole or water-filler,
1s. 6d.; spring safety-valve set to 30 lb. the inch, 1s. 4d. If these are not
already fitted with screw-blocks get them so fitted when buying them. <a href="#FigV12">Fig. 12</a>
represents the safety-valve with the screw-block.</p>

<p>Cut out of your copper a piece (<a href="#FigV13">Fig. 13</a>) eighteen inches and three-quarters long
and nine inches wide. Draw a line <span class="smcapall">A B</span> at right angles to the two long sides, and
bisecting them. From <span class="smcapall">A</span> and <span class="smcapall">B</span> mark off the distances shown in the figure. Bore
the holes, <span class="smcapall">C</span>, <span class="smcapall">D</span>,
<span class="smcapall">E</span>, and <span class="smcapall">F</span>, the sizes marked, and in the places indicated. Bend the
plate so that the middle eight inches form a semicircle with a radius of two and a
half inches, and the five-inch parts are straight and five inches apart. Turn in the
remaining half inch at each side to form a foot for the boiler to stand on. The
copper will now be like <a href="#FigV14">Fig. 14</a>, and will form the body of the boiler. Take two
small sheets of copper eight inches long by six inches wide, and mark one as in
<a href="#FigV15">Fig. 15</a> and the other as in <a href="#FigV16">Fig. 16</a>.
Cut them out carefully, and in <a href="#FigV15">Fig. 15</a> bore
two holes one-eighth of an inch in diameter in the places marked. Turn up the
edge all round the sides and circular portions of both plates, a quarter of an
inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
wide, till it is at right angles to the other part of the plate, as in <a href="#FigV17">Fig. 17</a>. Fit one
of these pieces on each end of the boiler body, so that the turned-up edges of the
ends fit outside the boiler body. The <a href="#FigV16">Fig. 16</a> is to fit over the end of the boiler that
has the two holes in the top. Solder or braze the ends to the boiler body.</p>

<p>I should strongly recommend all the joints of the boiler being brazed, as in the
event of the vessel steaming far from shore, the water running short, and the lamp
still burning, it would melt the solder, and the boiler would fall to pieces, but if
brazed it would not be injured if made red-hot. If you solder the parts together
you can do it yourself from directions given in the section on the <a href="#Page_231">magic-lantern</a>, but
in soldering copper or brass together both surfaces of the joint must be first tinned
over.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigV18">

</div>

<p>If you decide to have the joints brazed you can get it done at the ironmonger&#8217;s,
if you first cut out and fit the parts together and explain what you require. The
floor of the boiler is made out of a piece of sheet copper nine inches long and seven
and a half inches wide. Mark it as in <a href="#FigV18">Fig. 18</a>. Bend it along the lines into the
shape shown in <a href="#FigV19">Fig. 19</a>. In the middle of the top make a hole one-third of an inch
in diameter. Bore seven holes one-third of an inch in diameter along each of the
sides and half way up. Cut a piece of the brass tube six and a half inches long, and
braze one end of it into the hole in the top, as in <a href="#FigV19">Fig. 19</a>. Cut seven pieces of the
tube four and a half inches long each, and connect the holes on opposite sides by
brazing the tubes across into the holes, as in the <a href="#FigV19">figure</a>. Take the screw-block off
the safety-valve and solder it over the hole marked <span class="smcapall">D</span> in <a href="#FigV13">Fig. 13</a> on the inside of the
boiler. Solder the screw-block of the steam-tap inside over the hole marked <span class="smcapall">F</span>, and
solder on the inside the two blocks of the gauge-taps over the holes in the end of
the boiler. The block of the man-hole must be brazed on the outside over the
hole <span class="smcapall">C</span>, <a href="#FigV13">Fig. 13</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigV20">
<img src="images/illo089d.jpg" alt="boiler" width="400" height="244" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 20</p>
</div>

<p>Now fit the floor of the boiler in its place, passing the end of the tube, fastened
to the top of it, through the hole marked <span class="smcapall">E</span> in the top of the boiler, and projecting
about half an inch, and braze it in. <a href="#FigV20">Fig. 20</a> will show the position of the boiler
floor. The top of it is to be two inches from the bottom of the sides. Braze it in
firmly, being very careful to make all the joints steam-tight. Screw in the man-hole
cover, safety-valve, steam-tap, and gauge-taps. On the top of the boiler and
over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the projecting pipe solder a piece of brass tube seven inches long and an inch and a
quarter in diameter, raking aft a little, for the funnel. Now the boiler is finished
and ready to be connected with the engine. But before this can be done we must
make the reversing-gear.</p>

<p>Procure a block of brass, three-quarters of an inch wide, one inch long, and half
an inch high. Square this up true, and bore a hole right through it from top to
bottom, three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter. With the end of a rat-tailed file
taper the hole to a little more than a quarter of an inch at the top. Get a piece of
brass rod a little more than a quarter of an inch thick, and file one end of it taper to
fit the hole, and square off the bottom end of it, making the taper portion half an
inch long. Smoothen this with fine glasspaper, and then oil it and dust over it some
fine emery-powder, and put it in the hole in the block and grind the two together till
they fit perfectly. Cut the taper portion off exactly the length of the depth of the
block.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigV21">
<img src="images/illo090a.png" alt="boiler" width="350" height="231" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 21</p>
</div>

<p>Cut the brass away at the ends of the block, leaving a flange at the bottom, at
each end, a quarter of an inch long and one-sixteenth of an inch thick, as in <a href="#FigV21">Fig. 21</a>.
In each flange bore two small holes, to screw it to the top plate by. Drill four
holes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
one through each side of the block one-eighth of an inch in diameter, right into the
centre hole and at right angles to each other, as in <a href="#FigV21">Fig. 21</a>. Wipe the plug and
hole quite clean from the oil and emery, and replace the plug. Put a needle-point
into one of the side holes, and lying on the bottom of it and pressing against the
plug. Turn the plug round in the socket. Now move the needle-point to the top
of the hole and turn the plug round again.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigV22">
<img src="images/illo090b.png" alt="boiler" width="100" height="190" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 22</p>
</div>

<p>Take out the plug, and there will be two lines one-eighth of an inch apart scratched
all round it, as in <a href="#FigV22">Fig. 22</a>. With a small round file cut two grooves opposite each
other in the plug, by filing between the scratched lines, leaving the brass between
them one-sixteenth of an inch or less thick, as seen in <a href="#FigV22">Fig. 22</a>. Drill a hole one-eighth
of an inch in diameter and a quarter of an inch deep down the top end of the
plug, and another up the lower end, to fit one of your small screws. Be careful that
neither of these holes enters the grooves.</p>

<p>Cut a small circular plate of copper seven-sixteenths of an inch in diameter,
and drill a small hole in the middle of it. Give this plate two or three taps with a
small hammer in the middle to hollow it a little. Put the plug in its place in the
block, and turn it over and place the circular plate on the bottom, with the concave
side to the plug, and fix it there with a screw. This will keep the plug from coming
out of the block. Solder an iron wire one-eighth of an inch thick and six inches
long into the hole in the top of the plug. Fasten the block on to the square
projecting piece of the top plate, first cutting out of it a circular hole half an inch
in diameter, to let the circular plate at the bottom of the plug drop into. The valve
must now be connected with the steam-blocks. Take two pieces of steam-pipe
three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter and an inch and a quarter long, and bend
them the shape of <a href="#FigV23">Fig. 23</a>, so that the distance apart of the ends is the same as from
one hole in the top of one block to the corresponding hole in the other.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigV23">
<img src="images/illo090c.jpg" alt="boiler" width="231" height="200" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 23</p>
</div>

<p>Cut a hole in one side of the bent piece, as in <a href="#FigV23">Fig. 23</a>, large enough for the
end of another piece of the pipe to fit into when tapered a little. This piece is to
be about three and a quarter inches long, and bent so as to pass from the steam-blocks
round the cylinder to the hole in that side of the reversing-valve block. Fit
the end of this pipe into the hole in the bent tube and braze it in the following
way. Rub a small lump of borax on a moistened tile and rub the joint to be
brazed with the mixture of borax and water. Cut a small piece of silver off a
threepenny-piece about the size of a large pin-head, and put it on the joint. Now
hold the end of the tube in the left hand, covered with a cloth, and with a blow-pipe
direct the flame of a spirit-lamp or gas-jet on to the joint till it is red-hot, when
the silver will melt and flow round the joint and fix it. If you cannot do
this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
yourself a jeweller or watchmaker will do it for you. Make two of these bent
tubes with double ends, and solder them in their places, connecting the steam-blocks
with the reversing-valve. You must enlarge the holes, to let the ends of the
pipe in before soldering.</p>

<p>Bend a piece of steam-pipe, a quarter of an inch in diameter and eight inches
long, so that about two inches of one end stands at right angles to the other part.
The bend must be circular, or it will compress the pipe. Solder this end firmly into
the front hole in the reversing-valve. Bend another piece of the pipe about the
same length so as to go into the after hole of the valve and be parallel with the
other pipe. On the top of the boiler solder a piece of pipe about six inches long;
one end is to be bent up about one inch and inserted through a hole in the bottom
of the funnel, and directed upwards inside, the other end is to project about
one inch from the end of the boiler.</p>

<p>In the end of the steam-pipe solder the union of the steam-tap. Next make the
stand for the engine and boiler. Make it out of a piece of deal eighteen inches
long, five inches wide, and half an inch thick. Screw the bed-plate of the engine
on one end of it, so that the after end of the plate is flush with the stand. The
wood must be cut away under the square holes,
to let the cranks work in. Screw two strips of
copper at the other end, for the turned-in feet of
the boiler to slide under. Put them so that the
end of the boiler will be about three and a half
inches from the fore end of the bed-plate. Put
the boiler in its place, and bend the steam-pipe
so that the union can be screwed to the steam-tap
and the exhaust-pipe so that the end of it is opposite the projecting pipe from
the boiler, and connect these two ends with a piece of indiarubber tubing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigV24">
<img src="images/illo091.png" alt="boiler" width="300" height="145" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 24</p>
</div>

<p>The spirit-lamp must be in the shape of a closed box, made of sheet copper,
four inches wide, eight inches long, and three quarters of an inch deep. In the top
cut five holes, as in <a href="#FigV24">Fig. 24</a>, a quarter of an inch in diameter. In these holes solder
five tubes half an inch long, and projecting from the top a quarter of an inch.
These are for the wicks. At the front end of the top solder a screw filling-tap. At
this end solder also a piece of small pipe four inches long. This is to be bent so
that it will stand upright outside the end of the boiler, and is to act as a vent, to
prevent the spirit being forced too freely up the wicks. Fill the wick-holes tightly
with cotton. Now fill the lamp half full of spirit. Pour hot water into the boiler
till it just flows out of the top gauge-tap. See that all the taps are turned off.
Light the lamp and put it under the boiler, and while steam is getting up oil the
engine well with sewing-machine oil. In a short time the steam ought to be up
and the engine at work. Try the reversing-gear and see if it acts properly. The
engine ought to work smoothly and without noise, and the frame ought not to jar.</p>

<p>We must now make the screw propeller. The boat, which I suppose already
made, is to be five feet long, ten inches wide, and eight inches deep, without the
keel, and hollowed out to about a quarter of an inch thick at the gunwales and
three-quarters of an inch thick at the bottom, and must be rather flat-bottomed, as
steamships are, so that the inside at the bottom is five inches wide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigV25">
<img src="images/illo092.png" alt="propeller" width="450" height="264" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 25</p>
</div>

<p>Put the engine and boiler in the boat so that the boiler is a little abaft the
middle. Cut away the dead wood of the stern to make a hole four inches high and
two inches wide, as in <a href="#FigV25">Fig. 25</a>. Bore a hole from the hole in the dead wood right
through into the interior of the boat, as shown by the dotted lines in <a href="#FigV25">Fig. 25</a>. This
hole is to be directed to the centre of the fly-wheel of the engine. The shaft is
made out of the quarter-inch wire. Cut a square pin and shoulder three-eighths of
an inch long and an eighth of an inch square at one end of the shaft. Cut a piece
of the same wire three and a half inches long and drill a square hole in the middle,
and rivet it on the end of the shaft crosswise. In the hole in the stern of the boat
you must fix a tube and stuffing-box, which may be got&mdash;together with the screw,
which is to be a three-fanned one, measuring three inches across the fans&mdash;with the
other things, of Messrs. Theobald and Co., and similar houses.</p>

<p>Put the shaft in its place inside the boat, with the cross-piece resting across the
pins in the fly-wheel, about half way. Mark the end of the shaft so that it will
project an inch and three-quarters, and cut it off there. The bearing must now be
made out of a strip of brass
one-sixteenth of an inch
thick, three quarters of an
inch wide, and two inches
longer than the width of the
inside of the boat. In the
middle of this bore a hole
a quarter of an inch in
diameter, and bend one
inch of each end at right
angles to the other part.
In each bent piece drill
two small holes, to screw
them to the sides of the
boat by. Slip a piece of
tubing, one inch long and of a size to fit tightly on the shaft, close up against the
cross-piece. Put the shaft through the bearing and stuffing-box tube, and put the
cross-piece on the pins in the fly-wheel, and screw the bearing to the boat, so that
it is close against the tube on the shaft. The screw has a screw-bolt like the fly-wheel
to fix it to the shaft by. Drill a small hole in the shaft for it, and put the
screw on the end of the shaft and fix it by tightening the screw.</p>

<p>The deck of the boat must be cut the shape of the inside of the gunwales, out of
quarter-inch board, and is to be fixed so that the gunwales are one inch high. It
must have a hole cut in the middle to go over the boiler and pipes. A hole must
also be cut over the engine, and one also in the front part of the deck large enough
to admit your hand, to allow of your removing and lighting the lamp. These two
holes ought to be covered by movable skylights. A hole must be bored in the deck
just in front of the after-skylight for the wire from the reversing-valve to project
about half an inch. A wire handle must be fixed by riveting to the end of this, and
two pegs driven into the deck, one on each side, in front, to prevent the handle
being turned too far to either side. It should only turn one quarter of the way round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>If you have followed these directions your boat ought to steam for two hours and
a half without refilling the boiler; though the lamp would not burn all that time.
But if you solder a short piece of tube a quarter of an inch in diameter into the
front end of the lamp and quite at the bottom edge of it, and have a closed tin tank
with a like tube to it in the front part of the boat, and this tank is filled with spirits,
and connected to the lamp by a piece of india-rubber tubing joining the two tubes,
the lamp will supply itself from the tank as it gets low. The spirit from the tank
will not fill the lamp, but will just cover the hole of the tube and keep at that
height so long as there is any spirit in the tank. Such an engine as here
described would cost to purchase about &pound;7 10<i>s.</i>, and the boat with engine
complete, quite double that sum.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.&mdash;THE AMERICAN DANCING &#8216;NIGGER.&#8217;<br />

</div>

<p class="noindent">It is now some years since one evening at Christmas time I made one of a large
family party assembled at the house of a relative. The evening had passed very
pleasantly, and we were chatting together, and watching an arrangement which was
being made in a recess behind a pair of curtains, before which was a small table.
After some little time waiting in expectation, there suddenly appeared from between
the curtains the agile gentleman who is <a href="#FigVI01">portrayed</a> at the head of this chapter. The
operator, concealed (all but a portion of his arm) behind the curtains, placing the
stand on the table, and cleverly manipulating the wire, caused the figure to dance
in the most amusing and ridiculous manner, creating the greatest merriment.
Afterwards, some lively jigs and reels being played on the piano, the figure footed it
away, cleverly keeping time to the music.</p>

<p>Coming across the stand of the figure brought the memory of it to my mind,
and I thought that making and working such a figure would be an amusing occupation
for boys in the long winter evenings.</p>

<p>The nigger, when he first came out, was rather an expensive toy, and I have not
latterly seen anything quite like it, but it is within the capabilities of any ingenious
lad to make one for himself at a very small expense. The one I have described was
about eight inches high, and had a proportionately-sized stand; but of course it can
be made of any size, though a smaller one would be quite as troublesome to make,
and not so funny. We will take the figure as being about the height described.</p>

<span class="smcapall">E E</span> Stand.</p>
</div>

<p>The stand (<span class="smcapall">A</span>) is a piece of common deal about 13 in. long (for the figure eight
inches high; if the figure is made larger or smaller all details will of course also
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
proportionately more or less). The width of the stand is 2<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in., and it is shaped as
in the <a href="#FigVI01">sketch</a>. On top of the stand is a spring-board; this board is shaped as <a href="#FigVI02">Fig. 2</a>,
rather less than <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. thick. From <span class="smcapall">A</span>
to the shoulder at <span class="smcapall">B</span> is 6 in., and from <span class="smcapall">B</span> to the
centre of the hole at <span class="smcapall">D</span> is 9 in., the whole length being therefore 15 in., and the
spring-board in consequence projecting 4 in. beyond the end of the stand. At <span class="smcapall">D</span> on
the stand is a button screwed to the stand, the screw passing through the hole in the
spring-broad, and by tightening up the screw the spring-board can be made more or
less rigid as required. The spring marked <span class="smcapall">C C</span> (which can be put in either way;
the dotted line is perhaps the least effective way, as the greater the spring&mdash;within
limits&mdash;the better) is made of steel or iron wire, one end being stuck into the back
of the figure and the other being bent as in <a href="#FigVI03">Fig. 3</a>, and put under the button, the
screw passing through all, as shown in <a href="#FigVI04">Fig. 4</a>.</p>

<p>The next thing is the figure. The head you must shape as fancy dictates,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the result will be the criterion of your cleverness as a wood-carver. If you cannot
manage to carve a head, you might buy one and stick it on, or make your figure out
of a large Dutch doll.</p>

<p><a href="#FigVI08">Figures 8</a> and <a href="#FigVI09">9</a> speak for themselves. The flanges must correspond of course
with the slots, and a pin is run through to keep the leg in its place, while it is fitted
loosely so as to swing. The lower part of the leg and boot should be made rather
heavy, so as to come down with some force on the spring-board.</p>

<p>When you have made your figure you can dress him if you like, but the legs
must be left free at the joints. Loose trousers of very light striped stuff can be
fitted, but they must not come much below the knee. The figure may be painted
a dark brown, the hat red or white, the boots of course black, and the stand green
or blue picked out with black, but you must use your taste in these matters.
When all is finished it is not difficult to make the gentleman dance; but still your
spring-board must be tightened to the right pitch, and the spring wire bent so that
the feet of the figure are just off the spring-board; then by slightly agitating the wire
the nigger will commence to dance; and it will entirely depend on its owner&#8217;s
tuneful ear whether he dances in time to the music or not.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.&mdash;MOVING MODELS, AND HOW TO MAKE THEM;<br />
<span class="fsize80">OR, &#8216;DROP A PENNY IN THE BOX AND THE MODEL WILL WORK.&#8217;</span><br />
<span class="smcap">By Frank Chasemore.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">Many a penny have I invested when, as a lad, visiting such places of amusement as
the Crystal Palace, Polytechnic, London Crystal Palace, and Pantechnicon, in
obedience to the entreaty forming the sub-title of this chapter, placed on the cases
containing models and figures; and I yet very vividly remember the delight
experienced from seeing the models start into motion. Indeed, even now, though
arrived at man&#8217;s estate, I rarely miss dropping a penny into the coffer of any case
containing a moving model when I chance to come across one.</p>

<p>Now these models, complicated as they may sometimes seem, can be easily
made by any boy who can use his tools, and, as the construction and exhibition of
them will afford great amusement, I propose in this chapter to give detailed practical
instructions for making them.</p>

<p>The subjects I have chosen are a windmill, a yacht in full sail, a watermill with
real water, dancing niggers, etc., so that there should be sufficient variety to suit all
tastes and skill.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Model Windmill.</span></h4>

<p>The windmill being the simplest in construction of the working models, we will
take it first. The model, with the necessary pictorial background, is to be enclosed
in a case, which will bear somewhere on the front of it the legend forming the title
of this chapter, and the sails will go merrily round on dropping a penny into the box,
thus practically illustrating the old song, &#8216;Money makes the mill to go.&#8217; The cost
of the whole model and case will be something under 8<i>s.</i> Now for the construction.</p>

<p>We will make the case first. For this get some half-inch deal board, 12 in.
wide, and plane it smooth on both sides. Cut the pieces for the back, top, bottom,
and sides, and square them up true. The dimensions of these pieces are as follows:
the back, 20 in. long and 12 in. wide; the top and bottom pieces, 12 in. long and
10 in. wide; and the two side pieces are each 20 in. long and 10 in. wide.</p>

<p>Having cut and trued up these pieces, proceed to form them into a box by
joining the edges by dovetailing, if you are skilful at cabinet-making, or get some
friendly carpenter to do it for you, if you are not up to the work. If you cannot
manage either to do it yourself or to get it done for you, the parts can be joined
with glue and screws, but the side pieces will have to be cut one inch shorter than
for dovetailing, in order that the top and bottom pieces may fit in flush with the
back piece.</p>

<p>The front of the box is to be closed by a door, of which the upper 12 in. is of
glass. Make the door out of a piece of half-inch board, 8 in. by 11 in. for the
bottom piece, and fasten to each end a strip of wood 20 in. long and
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. square,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
so that one end of each strip is flush with the lower edge of the board, leaving 12 in
of each strip projecting beyond the upper edge.</p>

<p>These strips should have a groove <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. deep cut in them to hold the glass.
This you had better get cut for you. Put your glass, which must be about 11<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.
wide and 11 in. long, into the grooves, and the upper edge of it will be half an inch
from the ends of the strips. Fasten it in by a cross-piece of wood <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. square and
11 in. long, glued and screwed to the two side strips.</p>

<p>If you prefer it, the glass
can be put in the door
after the manner of window-panes.
In this case the
side and top strips must
have a rebate cut in them,
and the top edge of the
wooden portion served in
the same way. You must
choose for yourself which
method you will adopt.
Either will do, but the latter
is perhaps the neater.</p>

<p>In the top of the right-hand
end of the wooden
portion cut a slot large
enough to allow the necessary
penny to pass freely.
The door you will fasten to
the box with two small
brass hinges, and you must
put a small brass hook on
the other side of the box to
keep it fastened. But it
will be better if you do not
hang the door till the inside
arrangements are completed,
for fear of breaking
the glass.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigVII01">
<img src="images/illo098.jpg" alt="windmill" width="423" height="550" title="DROP A PENNY IN THE BOX AND THE MODEL WILL WORK" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#FigVII01">Fig. 1</a> represents the
case and model complete.
Divide the interior of the box into two portions by a horizontal partition, fastened
to the back and sides by glue and screws. The space below the partition is to be
7 in. deep. In the right of this space fit a cash drawer 9 in. long, 3 in. deep, and
3 in. wide, to hold the pennies. The side of this drawer nearest the machinery
must have a slot cut in it for the starting lever (<span class="smcapall">A</span>, <a href="#FigVII03">Fig. 3</a>) to work in. The sides of
the case are made of wood, so that the working of the model can only be seen from
the front and so that the flow of pennies will be larger.</p>

<p>Paint the back of the inside of the case to represent a landscape, or a
suitably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
coloured picture can be pasted in, and serve the horizontal partition in the same
manner to represent ground, blending the back and ground together in a natural
manner. Paint also the top board to represent sky.</p>

<p>Make the mill out of wood or cardboard. It is to be 7<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. high, and the holes
for the spindle carrying the sails 5<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. from the bottom.
The sails are to be 9<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in.
across, and can be made of wood or cardboard, or, better still, wood cross-pieces
with cardboard sails. Make the spindle of iron wire <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. in thickness. It should
be about 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. long. Flatten one end of the wire and drive it into the centre point
of the cross-pieces of the sails, being careful to keep it quite square and upright.</p>

<p>Pass the spindle through the holes in the back and front of the mill, and put a
knob of sealing-wax on the end, to prevent it working out when the mill is at work.
If the mill is made of cardboard, the inside must be strengthened with wood to
support the spindle.</p>

<p>We will next turn our attention to the mechanism to set the mill in motion.
Very few of my readers possess the tools and skill to use them necessary to cut and
fit the wheels, and, as it would come very expensive to get them made specially, it
will come very much cheaper to buy one of the cheap eight-day clocks, which will
suit our purpose admirably. These can be procured at most of the suitable shops,
and will cost about 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Take the frame and works out of the clock case, and remove the pendulum and
hands, as you will not require them. If you now turn round the spindle on which
the minute hand fits, you will notice that, although the parts that carry the hands
are in motion, the rest of the wheels are stationary. On examining these hand-turning
wheels carefully, you will notice that the one carrying the minute hand is
fixed on the central spindle by jambing only, and that it turns a small flat wheel
which, in turn, gives motion to the wheel carrying the hour hand. This wheel is
fixed to a tubular spindle, which fits over the spindle of the minute-hand wheel,
which itself is tubular and jambs on the central spindle. Now, as you will not
require this movement, take off the hour-hand wheel, and after removing the
small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
flat wheel, replace it and fasten it, together with the minute-hand wheel, to the
central spindle with solder.</p>

<p>Some of the cheap clocks have the minute hand fixed direct to the central
spindle, the hour wheel only being tubular. In this case the hour wheel and the
spindle must be soldered together after the small flat wheel has been removed. As
you will not require the escapement wheel, push on one side the small spring clip
that presses on the end of the spindle, and it will drop out.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigVII02">

</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigVII03">
<img src="images/illo099b.jpg" alt="windmill" width="450" height="381" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>You will now want a pulley wheel (<span class="smcapall">B</span>, <a href="#FigVII03">Fig. 3</a>). One of the wooden sheaves used
in Venetian blinds for the cords to run over will do very well indeed, or if you
possess a lathe you can turn one for yourself. It should be 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. in diameter and
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. thick, having a small hole right through the centre, of a size to fit tightly on
the hour spindle of your works. <a href="#FigVII02">Fig. 2</a> represents the frame after the wheels not
required have been removed. <a href="#FigVII03">Fig. 3</a> represents the starting lever and pulley. This
pulley must have a notch <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. deep cut in one rim, for the hook of the lever to fall
into and stop the machinery. This pulley must not be more than 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. in diameter,
or you will not be able to get at the winding-up pin.</p>

<p>The frame carrying the wheels must now be mounted in its place under the
horizontal partition. For this purpose fasten with screws a block of wood to the
floor board, or back of the case, in such a position that the front of the frame is
about 5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. from the front of the case, and so that the centre of the wooden wheel
is about 4 in. from the horizontal partition, and immediately under the spindle
carrying the sails of the mill. The horizontal partition must have a slot cut in it,
inside the mill, for the connecting cord to pass. The frame is to be fastened to the
supporting block by screws, but before doing this you must make the all-important
starting and stopping lever.</p>

<p>Get a piece of iron wire <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. thick, and about 10 in. long. Flatten one end and
bend down about half an inch of this end to form a hook, standing about at right
angles to the length; place this hook in the notch of the wheel when it is a little
beyond the centre of the pulley, as seen in the cut, and cut the wire to such a length
that the other end of it will be about 1 in. from the side of the case, when the gear
is in position. Drill a hole crosswise through the wire about 3 in. from the hook,
and fasten a small wire to the gear-frame, standing at right angles to it, about 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in.,
measured horizontally from the spindle of the pulley, and near the top. This is for
the lever to turn on, as shown in the cut. At the free end of the lever solder a
piece of tin bent up on three sides like a small tray, with the edge not bent at the
extreme end. This tray or scoop should be about 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. square, and is to catch the
penny as it is dropped in.</p>

<p>The hooked end of the lever must be weighted, to slightly outbalance the other
part, so that the hook will drop into the notch in the pulley. The frame can now
be put in its place and fixed to the block with screws. Bend the long end of the
lever till the scoop is 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. from the under side of the partition. In bending the
lever you must also see that the scoop is horizontal, or the penny will not remain in
it long enough to start the gear. Now connect the spindle of the sails and the
wooden pulley-wheel by passing a silk cord or fine string round both tightly, and
knotting the ends together.</p>

<p>Now on winding up the spring and pressing down the lever the works will
start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
into motion and the sails will revolve. The speed can be regulated by placing
the sails at such an angle that they will offer more or less resistance to
the air.</p>

<p>The slot in the door for the insertion of the penny must be cut three-quarters of
an inch below the upper edge of the wooden partition, and inside you must fasten a
tin trough to conduct the penny to the scoop at the end of the lever. This trough
must slope downwards to the edge of the scoop, or the penny will not fall into it, but
remain just inside the hole.</p>

<p>The model is now complete, and works as follows: The spring having been
wound up and the door closed, the works are kept from moving by the hook of the
lever catching in the notch of the pulley, but on a penny being put into the hole,
and sliding into the scoop at the other end of the lever, its weight presses down the
scoop end and lifts the hooked end out of the notch in the pulley, which turns
round, and continues to do so, carrying the sails of the mill round with it till the
notch again comes under the hook, which (the penny having fallen out of the scoop
into the drawer) falls into it and stops the machinery, giving one revolution of the
pulley for a penny. The pulley being twelve times larger than the spindle of the
sails, these will revolve twelve times each time the model is started. The model will
work about 204 times each time it is wound up.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Model Cutter Yacht.</span></h4>

<p>Having finished the windmill to your satisfaction, we will now turn our attention
to the construction of a model requiring rather more complex machinery. This is
shown at <a href="#FigVII04">Fig. 4</a>, and represents a cutter-yacht sailing on the port tack, on a lee
shore; which, if carefully made, so as to produce the effect of the rolling and pitching
of a real yacht upon a real sea, will catch many a penny.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigVII04">
<img src="images/illo102.jpg" alt="yacht" width="449" height="550" title="I'm ready and willing
To take a spin
If you're as ready
To drop a penny in." />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.</p>
</div>

<p>The case is made exactly in the same manner as the former one, and has the
same dimensions, but has no horizontal partition, only a cross-piece in the front,
half an inch square.</p>

<p>The inside of the back you must paint to represent a cliff and sky, or you can
paste a coloured picture of the same on it.</p>

<p>The yacht is to be 5 in. long, and is to be set in a sea of silk, which will be
described <a href="#Ref15">further on</a>. If you prefer it, a full-rigged ship can be substituted for the
yacht. For the machinery you will require, as before, an eight-day clock movement,
some brass wire, and three or four pulley-wheels. <a href="#FigVII05">Fig. 5</a> shows the front view of
the mechanism when complete, and <a href="#FigVII06">Fig. 6</a> the end view of the same.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigVII05">

<p class="caption">Fig. 6.</p>
</div>

<p>As was the case in preparing the works for the windmill, you will require to
make some alteration in the wheels, but in this case, as the hour and minute
movement will be required for the starting gear, the minute spindle only is to be
soldered to the central spindle, and the small flat wheel retained in its place. The
escapement wheel must also be retained. <span class="smcapall">B</span> (<a href="#FigVII05">Fig. 5</a>) is one of the wooden pulleys,
1 in. in diameter, fixed to the minute-hand spindle, and is in connection with
another pulley-wheel of the same size (<span class="smcapall">B</span>), turning on a screw fixed in a block of
wood fastened to the floor-board in such a position that the centres of the two
pulleys are the same height from the floor and 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
in. apart. <span class="smcapall">O</span> is a lever of wire
about 7 in. long, working on a pivot passing through it about
2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. from the end
<span class="smcapall">C</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
This end is connected with the keel of the boat, and the other end is weighted, to
balance the boat.</p>

<p>Now take your boat, and at each end of the keel fix a small brass plate having
a hole drilled in it (<span class="smcapall">FF</span>, <a href="#FigVII05">Fig. 5</a>),
4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. apart, and fix another plate drilled in the
same way at <span class="smcapall">C</span>, about 2<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. from the stem of the boat. Take two pieces of wire
5 in. long and bend one end of each into an eye and the other end into a hook,
crosswise with regard to the eye, and hook a wire into each of the plates <span class="smcapall">FF</span>, on the
keel of the boat, and
connect the other ends
with the pulleys <span class="smcapall">B</span> and
<span class="smcapall">B</span> by two small brass
screws passing into the
fronts of <span class="smcapall">BB</span>, as shown
in <a href="#FigVII05">Fig. 5</a>, and arrange
the pulleys so that one
of the pivots shall be
up while the other is
down.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigVII07">
<img src="images/illo104b.png" alt="yacht" width="150" height="150" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.</p>
</div>

<p>All these joints and
connections must work
freely, although not
loosely. The two pulleys,
<span class="smcapall">BB</span>, you must
connect with a cord
passing round both.
The pitch of the vessel
is regulated by the
distance the pivot
screws are from the
centres of the pulleys,
which should be about
half an inch. You
must next make the
regulating gear or fly <span class="smcapall">E</span>
(<a href="#FigVII05">Fig. 5</a>). To do this
you must take out the
pin from the left-hand
lower corner of the
frame-plate and prise
up the plate and take out the fourth wheel near <span class="smcapall">R</span> (<a href="#FigVII05">Fig. 5</a>), and on the spindle of it
fix a pulley, which can be readily done in the following manner. Cut a small notch
in one side of the hole in the centre of the pulley just large enough to admit a
piece of your wire. Solder about half an inch of this wire along one side of the
spindle about the middle of it, and force the pulley on to the spindle over this
piece, and it will jamb lightly and be keyed to it. <a href="#FigVII07">Fig. 7</a> will show you how to cut
the hole in the pulley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Now return the wheel to its place and re-fasten the frame-plate. Next you must
make the fly <span class="smcapall">E</span>. Get a small brass pulley about
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. in diameter, and to it solder a strip
of tin cut to the shape shown, but being wider in proportion at the ends, say 1 in. wide
and 4 in. long. Twist the ends of this fly askew like the fans of a screw propeller,
so that it will catch the wind in revolving. Now fix a block of wood to the bottom
of the case and fix the fly to it by a small brass screw passing through its centre, so
that it works freely and is 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. from the centre
of the driving pulley <span class="smcapall">R</span> and level
with it. Fasten a block of wood to the back of the case, in which you must fix the
screw <span class="smcapall">N</span> (<a href="#FigVII05">Fig. 5</a>) for the
lever <span class="smcapall">O</span> to pivot on. You must next make the starting gear.
This is shown in <a href="#FigVII08">Fig. 8</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigVII08">
<img src="images/illo104c.jpg" alt="yacht" width="600" height="234" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 8.</p>
</div>

<p>As we require the pulleys <span class="smcapall">BB</span> to revolve about twelve times, and as they are
attached to the minute-hand spindle, the hour-hand spindle will revolve once.
Therefore, on this spindle fix behind the pulley <span class="smcapall">B</span>, by soldering, a circular plate of
tin or brass, a little larger than the pulley, and cut in one edge of it a slot a quarter-inch
deep and one-eighth of an inch wide. Make your lever as before, but long
enough for the hook to catch in the teeth of the wheel <span class="smcapall">C</span>, <a href="#FigVII08">Fig. 8</a>; and solder a piece
of tin to the lever, to fall at the same time into the slot in the
disc <span class="smcapall">A</span>, <a href="#FigVII08">Fig. 8</a>. This
piece of tin must be long enough to keep the hook free of the teeth of the wheel <span class="smcapall">C</span>
during the revolution of the disc <span class="smcapall">A</span>. The length of the other part of the lever is to
be the same as for the windmill. <a href="#FigVII06">Fig. 6</a> shows an end view of the machinery. <span class="smcapall">K</span> is
a wire connecting the keel with the lever <span class="smcapall">Q</span>, and helps to give the rolling motion so
suggestive to voyagers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p id="Ref15">Fix your gear into the case in such a position that the keel of the boat will be
7 in. above the floor of the box, and bend
the starting lever so that the scoop will be
the same distance from the floor and front
of the box as in the former case. You have
now to make the sea. Get a piece of silk
of the kind called Persian, dark green or
&#8216;undecided&#8217; blue, about 18 in. square, and
in the middle of it cut a slit 6 in. long, and
in this slit fasten the hull of the boat with
glue, puckering up the silk, to form the
waves on the sides of the vessel. Crumple
the whole of the silk into miniature waves,
and glue the edges round the edges of the
case and to the strip of wood fastened
across the front 7 in. from the floor. Touch
the crests of the waves with white paint.
The silk waves will rise and fall with the motion of the vessel, and appear themselves
to be the cause of that motion. If the silk has a tendency to drop in, it can
be supported by a floor-board, 7 in. from the bottom, with a hole cut in the centre
5 in. long and 2 in. wide for the boat to work in, and a slot cut for the wire <span class="smcapall">K</span>,
<a href="#FigVII06">Fig. 6</a>. Be very careful that all the joints and connections work easily, or a jerky
motion will be the result.</p>

<p>Wind up the works and drop in a penny, and the lever hook will be lifted out of
the escapement wheel, and round will go the pulleys, causing the little ship to pitch
and roll till the slot <span class="smcapall">A</span> comes round again, when down falls the lever hook and stops
the movement. The pace of the movement can be regulated by the angle of the
fans of the fly catching more or less air.</p>

<p>As the minute spindle revolves twelve times, the pulleys will revolve only once,
which will give about seventeen revolutions each time of winding.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Dancing &#8216;Niggers.&#8217;</span></h4>

<p><a href="#FigVII09">Fig. 9</a> is a view of a case of dancing &#8216;niggers,&#8217; and is easily made. In the
sketch the figures are one-third the real size.</p>

DROP A PENNY IN THE BOX" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 9.</p>
</div>

<p>The case measures 9 in. high, 7 in. wide, and 7 in. deep. The back forms a
hinged door by which you can get at the gear. The slit for the penny is in the top,
and near the right-hand back corner. The legs of the right-hand figure are both
made separate from the body and
jointed at the knees. They are
fastened to the body by small
pins, to allow of free working.
This figure you must strengthen
by glueing a piece of wood behind
it 1 in. long, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. wide, and
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. thick. The other figure has
only the left leg moveable, and
must not be jointed at the knee.
Glue a strip of wood about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in.
wide and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. thick right up the
back of this figure, and glue it to
the floor board. The left leg must
have a similar piece of wood
glued behind it, and projecting
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. longer at the thigh end. Fix
the leg to the body by a small pin,
for it to work freely on, and in the
piece of wood projecting fix, at
right angles, a piece of wire about
2 in. long, and cut a curved slit
in the background for this to
work in, when the figure is about
1 in. from it.</p>

<p>This background you must
make out of cardboard, and fix
about 3 in. from the front of the
case, which is glass. The background
you can paint to any design you please, such as a street scene, or on
the sands, and the floor to correspond.</p>

<p>Behind the right-hand figure cut a vertical slit in the background about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in.
wide and 2 in. long, so that the centre of it comes opposite the centre of the figure
when the feet are just touching the floor. Fix a piece of wire about 7 in. long into
the centre of the figure behind, and at right angles to it, and bend this wire downwards
at right angles about 2 in. from the figure. About 1 in. behind the background
fix an upright block of wood, to come as high as the centre of the figure, and in
front of it fix two small staples, one near the top, and the other about 2 in. lower,
but directly under it. Into these slip the end of the wire attached to the figure, after
passing it through the slot in the background. This will keep the figure in its
place and allow of its moving up and down.</p>

<p>Prepare the works as for the yacht model, and also insert a pulley (<span class="smcapall">A</span>), as
shown in <a href="#FigVII10">Figs. 10</a> and <a href="#FigVII05">5</a>. This is connected with another pulley (<span
class="smcapall">B</span>, <a href="#FigVII10">Fig. 10</a>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
which is fixed to a block by a screw that is countersunk below the face of it, and
to which is fastened by a small screw two wires working freely and passing one to the
wire from the left-hand figure,
and the other to the cross-piece
of the wire from the
right-hand one, and connected
with them by the ends
being bent into rings. From
the cross wire to the figure
to the right is also hung a
drop wire with a small weight
at the end, to help to pull it
down. <a href="#FigVII11">Fig. 11</a> will explain
the fixing of this gear. A
fly must be also fitted to the
movement, to check the pace.
This can be fixed to the
pulley (<span class="smcapall">B</span>) or in front of the
escapement wheel. The
stopping motion is the same
as in <a href="#FigVII08">Fig. 8</a>, but more slots
may be cut in the disc, to
regulate the length of time
allowed for a penny.</p>

<p>The works you must fix
behind the background so
that the starting lever comes
conveniently for the penny
in its fall.</p>

<p>With these three examples
of the necessary
clockwork you will be able
by the exercise of a little ingenuity and the power of contriving to make moving
models of any subjects that may suggest themselves to you, such as the following: a
steamboat with revolving paddle-wheels, cobbler mending shoes, soldiers marching,
etc., etc.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Real Water-wheel.</span></h4>

<p>I will now tell you how to make the model shown in <a href="#FigVII12">Fig. 12</a>, consisting of a
water-mill working with real water, a small fountain in the middle, and children
playing at see-saw in the background.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigVII12">

FOUNTAIN &amp; SWING

DROP A PENNY IN
THE BOX
TO START THE MODEL" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 12.</p>
</div>

<p>This model is worked with water-power only, and has no clockwork. The case
you must make larger than in either of the former cases&mdash;24 in. high, 14 in. wide,
and 14 in. deep; the height of the floor of the model from the bottom of the case
4 in., and the depth of the upper partition 4 in., the intermediate space closed by
a glass door 16 in. by 14 in. The case must be made out of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. stuff and well
dovetailed together. In the right-hand bottom corner a drawer for the
pennies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
with a slot in front. The back or one of the sides should have a door in it, to
get at the machinery, should it at any time require attending to.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigVII13">
<img src="images/illo108a.jpg" alt="water-wheel" width="350" height="476" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 13.</p>
</div>

<p>You must now make two zinc tanks, the top one air-tight, to occupy the whole
of the upper space, the other also air-tight at first, to occupy the space left in the
lower partition by the drawer. The top tank will be 13 in. by 13 in. by 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in., and
will have a small receiver, about 6 in. square by 1 in. deep, soldered to the bottom
of it, and communication with it by a small hole, as shown in <span class="smcapall">E</span>, <a href="#FigVII13">Fig. 13</a>, about a
quarter of an inch in diameter, and having also a small pipe passing from it to the
outer air through the large tank. This pipe is not shown in the figure, but it is
soldered to the top and bottom of the tank and the ends filed off flush. The zinc
for the bottom and sides of the tanks can be cut out of one piece, as shown in
<a href="#FigVII14">Fig. 14</a>. The edges of the tops should be turned over, to add strength. The
soldering must be made air-tight. The background of the picture is a false
back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
inserted about 2 in. from the true one, behind which the pipes are placed connecting
the vessels together, as shown in <a href="#FigVII13">Fig. 13</a>, which is a back view.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigVII14">
<img src="images/illo108b.png" alt="water-wheel" width="250" height="249" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 14.</p>
</div>

<p>These pipes must be carefully soldered
in. <span class="smcapall">A</span> is the air-pipe to supply reservoir <span class="smcapall">F</span>
when in use; <span class="smcapall">B</span> is the pumping-pipe, in
the middle of which is fixed an india-rubber
force-ball, to be procured at any
india-rubber shop, in which is a small
pin-valve, to prevent the water flowing
back. This pipe extends from the bottom
of tank <span class="smcapall">G</span> to the top of tank <span class="smcapall">F</span>, leaving
a space of about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. between the ends
of the pipes and the metal of the tanks.
<span class="smcapall">C</span> is a small pipe by which the water from
the basin of the fountain is run into <span class="smcapall">G</span>.
<span class="smcapall">E</span> is the receiver into which water from <span class="smcapall">F</span>
runs, and from which two pipes lead, one
to the wheel of the mill, and the other
to the fountain. <span class="smcapall">K</span> is a regulating tap, to
govern the supply of air and regulate the
amount of water passed into <span class="smcapall">E</span>. <span class="smcapall">D</span> is the
stopcock connected with the starting
lever, which is about 6 in. long and
soldered to the handle of the tap. This
tap must work easily, and yet be air-tight.</p>

<p>The lever must be counterweighted,
to close the tap when the penny has fallen
off the scoop at the end of the lever.
<span class="smcapall">H</span> is a small pipe fixed in the top of the
tank <span class="smcapall">G</span> to allow the air to pass out when
the water is running into it through <span class="smcapall">C</span>.
The basin of the fountain should be
made of zinc, and fastened to the tube <span class="smcapall">C</span>,
and the jet is formed of the end of a
blow-pipe connected to the tube from <span class="smcapall">E</span>.
The rockery you must form of cinders
and paint them to a suitable colour.
The mill-wheel should be made of zinc
and painted, and the water from it conducted
to the basin of the fountain. The
other pipe from <span class="smcapall">E</span> you must conduct to a
position suitable to set the wheel in
motion.</p>

<p>The see-saw you must place so that
it can be set in motion by the axle of the mill-wheel, which is carried out long
enough under the rockery-bank to reach it, and has a cross-piece of wire
soldered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to it at a point immediately under one of the figures, and which in revolving tips
up one end of the board.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigVII15">
<img src="images/illo109.jpg" alt="water-wheel" width="350" height="438" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 15.</p>
</div>

<p>This end of the board is made, slightly heavier than the other, which will make it
return to be again tipped up. We will now
see how the model is worked. Pour water
into the basin of the fountain till it is full,
and open the starting lever as shown in
<a href="#FigVII15">Fig. 15</a>. The bottom vessel will now be
quite full. Now work the force-ball, which
will pump the water out of <span class="smcapall">G</span> into <span class="smcapall">F</span>, the air
rushing into <span class="smcapall">G</span> through the pipe <span class="smcapall">H</span>. As soon
as the upper tank is full the starting lever is
to be closed, and the model is ready to begin
work. Now as <span class="smcapall">F</span>, <a href="#FigVII13">Fig. 13</a>, is an air-tight
vessel, no water can run from <span class="smcapall">F</span> into <span class="smcapall">E</span>. But
as soon as a coin is dropped into the scoop
at the end of the lever <span class="smcapall">A</span>, <a href="#FigVII15">Fig. 15</a>, its weight
presses it down and opens the cock <span class="smcapall">D</span>, which
allows the air to be drawn into <span class="smcapall">F</span>, and consequently
allows water to pass into <span class="smcapall">E</span>, <a href="#FigVII13">Fig. 13</a>.</p>

<p>The quantity of air allowed to pass is
regulated by the extent to which <span class="smcapall">K</span>, <a href="#FigVII13">Fig. 13</a>,
is opened. The water being in <span class="smcapall">E</span>, and this
vessel communicating with the atmosphere
through the pipe not shown in the Figs.,
the water falls into the two pipes, and is conducted by one to set the wheel in
motion, and by the other to the fountain-jet, through which it issues and again falls
into the basin, and thence again into <span class="smcapall">G</span>.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">How to make a Cheap Clock.</span></h4>

<p>An ingenious and inexpensive timekeeper may be made by any boy for a few
pence and a little labour. Buy a sheet of millboard, the thicker the better&mdash;size,
27 in. by 22 in.&mdash;cut off a strip 10 in. by 27 in., and shape it as shown in <a href="#FigVII16">Fig. 16</a>,
the top part to be 10 in. square, and the lower 17 in. by 4 in. Next mark off the
remainder of the millboard into three equal parts of 4 in. each, as shown in <a href="#FigVII17">Fig. 17</a>,
then, with a straightedge and a sharp knife, cut half through the lines <span class="smcapall">AA</span>. This
will form the two sides and back of the case. The funnel (<span class="smcapall">B</span>, <a href="#FigVII18">Fig. 18</a>) should be made
of tin, with a square top to fit over the millboard, and have a very small aperture at
the point; any tinman will make this for 3<i>d.</i> or 4<i>d.</i> The spindle
(<span class="smcapall">C</span>, <a href="#FigVII18">Fig. 18</a>) must be
3<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. long, 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
in. deep in front, diminishing to 2 in. at back, have a screw-shaped
groove from end to end, and work on a small spindle or axle, projecting 1 in.
in front, for the hand to be connected to, and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> an inch at rear. If the young
horologist has not a lathe at his disposal, the spindle can be obtained from a turner
for a few pence. The weight may be made of a piece of shaped stone, or of an
empty stone ink-bottle, from the neck of which the cord passes over the bar (<span class="smcapall">C</span>),
round the grooves of the spindle, and out of the hole
(<span class="smcapall">K</span>). A small weight, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
as a bullet, must be fastened to the other end. A piece of canvas should be
glued round the edges of the case, and the whole painted with a good coating
of Brunswick black, over which any design may be made, either with gold lines,
grotesque figures, or coloured pictures. The dial should be of white paper, 7 in. in
diameter, and the hand cut out of the spare millboard and then gilded. Four small
reels (<span class="smcapall">E</span>, <a href="#FigVII17">Fig. 17</a>), such
as are used for silk,
should be glued on
the back, to keep the
case from the wall,
and a ring fastened
to the top to hang
it by.</p>

<p>It is now ready
for the motive power,
which is obtained by
the falling of sand,
as in the hour-glass.
The sand must be first
well washed, dried,
and sifted, to remove
all stones, then
poured through the
case top to within two
inches of the cross-bar
(<span class="smcapall">C</span>, <a href="#FigVII18">Fig. 18</a>), the weight
resting on the surface. As the sand runs through the funnel-point
the weight will descend with it at the rate of about 1 in. per hour.
The flow of sand will be perfectly equable from the time the case is
filled until it is nearly empty, which is explained by the fact that the
sand lies in a succession of conical heaps, only the <i>first</i> of which
presses on the bottom, the others throwing their weight on the sides
of the case. A gallon of sand will be more than sufficient to fill the
cases, and as it falls it should be caught in a vase placed beneath
for that purpose. In winding up the clock the inside weight must be raised to
the cross-bar by pulling down the bullet end of the cord, and the sand poured
through a paper funnel into the top of the case, care being taken to set the hand
to the right hour. A clock of the dimensions here given will work for about
twelve hours, but by lengthening the sand-box the working hours will be increased
in proportion. It will save time and trouble to have a double supply of sand and
two vases, and use them alternately. Of course one does not pretend that such a
simple clock as this will keep accurate time.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;HOW WE MADE A CHRISTMAS SHIP.<br />
<span class="smcap">By C. Stansfeld-Hicks</span>, Author of <i>Yacht and Canoe Building</i>, &amp;c., &amp;c.</h3>

<p class="noindent">&#8216;What shall we do to amuse the boys?&#8217; was the question asked at a friend&#8217;s
house. &#8216;They are tired of Christmas trees, and it is so difficult to think of
anything new.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; I suggested, &#8216;why not have a Christmas ship?&#8217;</p>

<p>A Christmas ship! We never heard of such a thing! What is it?&#8217;</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigVIII01">
<img src="images/illo111.jpg" alt="ship" width="550" height="363" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Good Ship Santa Claus.</span></p>
</div>

<p>And this was the commencement of the planning and building of the vessel in
question. To commence was a comparatively easy matter, but before she was
finished and ready for her cargo the shipbuilders got rather weary. But you see
they had to do everything for the first time, and with little or no previous experience.
By attention to the details given in this chapter, those who go in for this Christmas
ship will get on faster than we did, profiting by our experience, and not having
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
retrace their steps and do things over again, which was often the case with us in
our first attempt.</p>

<p>When all was finished, the ship, as she appeared in the library, was an extremely
pretty sight, her long black hull illumined by the light from the open ports, through
which was caught a glimpse of her main deck with its fittings. Around her extended
a very realistic sea, ruffled in miniature waves, and far above, towering over the
heads of the young people present, were her lofty masts with their complicated
rigging. Some of the sails were set, while others were stowed on the yards. Deep
down in her hold were most of the presents, while many others were suspended
from her yards and rigging, which too were lighted up with small coloured lanterns.</p>

<p>Everything had been kept a profound secret until the library door was thrown
open to the guests, and the Christmas ship, glowing with her illuminations and
crammed full of presents, stood before them. Such was her capacity, that, although
there were some thirty or forty young people ready and eager to plunder her, it was
not until they had made three successive raids on the goods and cargo that the hold
was declared to be empty, and even then in some of its recesses there still remained
a few unappropriated gifts. And now to the details of her construction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigVIII02">
<img src="images/illo112a.jpg" alt="ship" width="600" height="148" />
<p class="caption">FIG 2</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigVIII03">
<img src="images/illo112b.jpg" alt="ship" width="600" height="207" />
<p class="caption">FIG 3</p>
</div>

<p>The first operation is to make the frame or stand. This is shown in <a href="#FigVIII02">Fig. 2</a> and
<a href="#FigVIII03">Fig. 3</a>, as well as in the <a href="#FigVIII01">sketch</a>
of the ship complete. It is marked <span class="smcapall">H H H H</span> in
<a href="#FigVIII03">Fig. 3</a>. The size of the stand will of course entirely depend on the size you intend
making the ship, but it should be in about the same proportion to the hull of the
vessel as is shown in the diagram (<a href="#FigVIII02">Fig. 2</a>). If the ship is to be 5 ft. long and 3 ft.
wide, the stand should be 8 ft. long. You will require two pieces of 11-in. deal
plank, <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. thick, and a short piece about 3 ft. long, which will be used as follows.
For the hold of the ship you must get a suitable box, which may be obtained
from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the grocer. An old currant or biscuit box will do. We used a Florence oil case,
which answered very well with the V end turned down and the bottom taken off
(see <a href="#FigVIII06">Fig. 6</a>). <a href="#FigVIII07">Fig. 7</a> shows the manner in which the boards for the stand are
arranged round the box. <span class="smcapall">A</span> is the box,
<span class="smcapall">B</span> an 11-in. board with a slot about 2 in.
deep cut to fit the box. <span class="smcapall">C</span> is a similar
board the other side, and <span class="smcapall">D D</span> are two filling
pieces placed between the long boards to fill up the space left at either end of the
box. A couple of cross pieces may be placed at the dotted lines to secure the
frame together. The top of the box is left flush with the upper edge of the stand.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FigVIII03">Fig. 3</a> the dotted line shows the outline of the box. When the stand is made
and put together, the simplest plan to adopt is to take any large packing case which
the stand will cover, by about a foot at each end and a few inches at the sides, and
nail the stand down on this case. A block of wood must then be put under where
the box for the hold comes, of sufficient thickness to keep this box up just flush
with the top of the stand, and when the block is nailed down the box can be
screwed to it. No fastening will be necessary at the top, as the stand should fit all
round it too closely to prevent it working. Care should be taken that there are no
nails or splinters inside the box, or when the presents are being taken out some
one&#8217;s fingers may suffer. It is a good plan to glue some smooth thick wrapping
paper over the inside of the box after it is screwed down.</p>

<p>The sides of the ship, which are only the height of the vessel above water, can
be made of thick cardboard. Millboard will do, but it cracks easily. The shape of
the side having been cut out, a couple of lines must be marked within which the
ports are to be cut. The lower edge of the port should be about two inches above
the water-line, and the ports themselves two inches high and three wide, the whole
height of the vessel&#8217;s side out of water amidships being about 6<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches (this is for
a 5 ft. ship), while at the bow it will be an inch or so higher and half an inch at the
stern (see <a href="#FigVIII01">Fig. 1</a>). In cutting the ports you will find a sharp chisel the best tool to
use, particularly if you are operating on thick millboard. When the ports are cut
out the pieces of millboard cut away will do for port lids (see <a href="#FigVIII10">Fig. 10</a>). <span class="smcapall">A</span> is the
ship&#8217;s side, <span class="smcapall">B</span> the port lid, which is hinged on to the upper port sill by a piece of
calico <span class="smcapall">D D</span>, glued on; <span class="smcapall">C</span>
is the tricing line for raising or lowering the port. <a href="#FigVIII09">Fig. 9</a>
shows the battens (<span class="smcapall">A A</span>). These are about an inch high and three-quarters thick;
they are screwed down on the stand just inside the line the side of the ship will take,
and serve to secure the lower part of the ship&#8217;s side by glue or screws; or another
batten can be run outside the ship&#8217;s side&mdash;the two battens taking one side of the
ship between them, and this is the stronger plan. The deck should be made of a
stout piece of deal board, about three-quarter-inch; it must be strong, as it serves
to bind the whole fabric together, and the sides are none too strong. This deck is
the upper deck, the main deck being formed by that part of the stand inside
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
vessel&#8217;s hull, and the main hatchway being the box. The deck must be placed just
at the top of the line of ports (see <span class="smcapall">A A</span> in <a href="#FigVIII08">Fig. 8</a>), so as to leave room between the
two decks, and also to leave a bulwark all round the upper deck. The stern may
be made of a piece of deal an inch thick, shaped as <a href="#FigVIII11">Fig. 11</a>. <a href="#FigVIII12">Fig. 12</a> shows the
section and the way the edges are bevelled off at <span class="smcapall">A A</span>. The bows can be fastened
together by screws or glue, to a wedge-shaped piece of wood put between them (see
<a href="#FigVIII13">Fig. 13</a>). <span class="smcapall">C</span> is a
triangular block of wood shaped to suit the vessel&#8217;s lines, <span class="smcapall">B B</span> the
millboard sides, <span class="smcapall">A</span> is a piece of millboard
or wood shaped as <a href="#FigVIII14">Fig. 14</a>. The part <span class="smcapall">A A</span>
goes between the sides which terminate at the line <span class="smcapall">B B</span>, shown in <a href="#FigVIII08">Fig. 8</a>. The hook
<span class="smcapall">B</span> is formed by a piece of wire inserted into the end of the knee of the head, and is
used to hang a small figure for a figure-head. Those little plaster angels which
have a small wire eye between the wings from which they are generally suspended
by elastic, are the most suitable, as the wings fit on either side of the bowsprit, and
the figure looks very well.</p>

<p>The most effective part of the affair has now to be described, and that is the way
the hold is lighted up. <a href="#FigVIII02">Fig. 2</a> shows this. <span class="smcapall">A</span> is a common paraffin lamp, with say
a three-quarter inch burner (though an inch is better); <span class="smcapall">L</span> is a tin reflector so fitted
as to throw the light downward and forward toward the bow; at <span class="smcapall">K</span> is a strong
partition to secure the lamp from being upset or damaged while the hold is being
pulled about for presents; <span class="smcapall">M M</span> shows the line of the main deck, opening from which
is the box <span class="smcapall">P</span>. The rays from this lamp light up the whole length forward of the
main deck, and, if the ports are open, send a bright radiance from them through
the room.</p>

<p>The upper deck must be fitted with a hatchway of sufficient size just over the
box which constitutes the hold, and this hatchway must be so placed that
every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
part of the box can be reached through it even by a small child. The ports may be
made to open and shut simultaneously by bringing all the tricing lines into one
hauling part, which on being pulled hauls up all the ports at once. This is very
effective if the ports fit well, as the room can be darkened, and the ports being
suddenly hauled up, the whole interior of the ship is shown brightly illuminated.</p>

<p>The fittings for the lamp on the upper deck have next to be considered. The
principal part is the funnel, which can be made of an old canister by cutting it
down where soldered together, reducing it to the required diameter and boring
holes along the lapping and lacing it together up the side. This is better than
soldering, as the heat of the lamp cannot affect the joint. The lower ends of the
tube are cut and opened out as at <a href="#FigVIII04">Fig. 4</a>, and a kind of tin washer is cut out
(<a href="#FigVIII05">Fig. 5</a>), the inner circle just being large enough to slip over the funnel, but being
stopped by the lower ends. The outside circumference of the washer must be
large enough to cover these ends. By screwing the washer down on the upper
deck, having previously slipped the funnel through it, the funnel is firmly fixed in
position, the rake being determined by the way in which the lower ends are cut.
To further steady the funnel and make a neat job, a small bridge is cut out of
another tin canister or piece of sheet-tin or zinc, as at <a href="#FigVIII04">Fig. 4</a>, <span class="smcapall">B B</span>. This may be
made of any suitable width and pierced with a hole in the centre to pass it over the
funnel; it is then bent down to the required curve, the ends joining the bulwarks
and fitting in the upper deck. A light rail may be fitted, as shown in the elevation,
or if the tin is cut as <a href="#FigVIII04">Fig. 4</a><span class="smcapall">A</span>
the side pieces <span class="smcapall">A A</span> can be bent up to form a rail.
This bridge may be painted with japan black, which can also be used for those
parts of the vessel which require to be painted black.</p>

<p>The partition <span class="smcapall">K</span> (<a href="#FigVIII02">Fig. 2</a>) must be made to remove, working in slides, so that the
reservoir of the lamp, by taking off the chimney, can be got out for filling and
trimming; the chimney is got off by pushing it up the funnel far enough to clear
the lamp.</p>

<p>It will have a good effect if a poop and topgallant forecastle are fitted, as in
<a href="#FigVIII08">Fig. 8</a>. <span class="smcapall">C</span> is the poop and
<span class="smcapall">D</span> the forecastle. These decks can be made of millboard,
and light strips of wood are glued along inside the rail or bulwark, the top of which
comes about half an inch short of the top of the rail. The small deck is then placed
so as to rest on these strips; it can be fitted with a rail as shown, or not, as the
builder decides.</p>

<p>The sea is made of green glazed calico, which must be large enough to cover
the stand and hang over all round, touching the floor and concealing the rough
stand and its supports. A long slit is made in the centre line of the calico, to pass
it over the ship&#8217;s hull, and it is then glued along the ship&#8217;s sides before they are
painted, care being taken that this is carefully done, no rucks or puckers being left.
The waves are made by rolls of thin paper introduced here and there, under the
calico and glued to the stand, and wherever a wave crest appears the calico is
touched up with white paint, and if this is artistically done the effect is very good.</p>

<p>The sides of the ship are now painted black, and if the calico comes far up on
the side, it must be painted over and considered as part of the vessel&#8217;s side; but
along the water-line there should be a certain amount of undulation indicated by
the paint, and at the bows and here and there along the side, a little white
paint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
must be put, to show the broken water and foam, while the vessel&#8217;s wake should also
be indicated by lines of foam diverging at an angle from the course of the ship.
Copper may be shown by a copper-red just at the bow and stern along the water,
but all black will do very well. The streak containing the ports should be painted
white, the outside of the ports black, and the inside red.</p>

<p>The rigging will now have attention. The masts may be made in only two
pieces; the topmasts, topgallant masts, and royals being all in one. The lower
masts should be rather stout, and can be made of common deal; they must be
firmly stepped in blocks secured below for their reception, and the mainmast must
be so placed as not to unduly interfere with the hold being got at. The rigging and
spars and sails of a ship are given in full with diagrams in other articles in this volume,
and need not be repeated here.</p>

<p>The character of the rigging and the number of sails set must depend on the
ideas of the builder. The ship may be made at anchor, to save trouble, with all her
sails stowed, and a good effect can be easily produced by furling the sails, as is the
case with the lower yards in the first illustration. Any rough piece of canvas the
proper size will do for this. The ends are made fast to the yardarms, the corners
are then folded behind (away from the bows) to the middle of the sail, in order to
make a bunt, and the sail rolled up and secured to the yard by lashings of thread
or string.</p>

<p>To look well, the sail when stowed should be much larger in the roll at the
middle and diminish off to nothing at the ends.</p>

<p>Those stays which it is intended to suspend lamps from should be of wire, and
the topgallant yards, if used for a similar purpose, should also be of wire, and if
the yardarms are used for this purpose short pieces of thick wire should be lashed
to them.</p>

<p>When all is ready, to allow of free access to the hold without damaging the sails
or rigging, it is best to brace the head yards sharp up and the main yards aback.
This is shown in <a href="#FigVIII15">Fig. 15</a>. By doing this a sufficient space is left on one side of the
ship. <span class="smcapall">A A</span> is the fore-and-aft line of the vessel,
<span class="smcapall">B</span> the fore yard, <span class="smcapall">C</span> main yard, showing
the space <span class="smcapall">B C</span>. <span class="smcapall">D</span> is the mizen trimmed in the same way as the fore yard. The
ship would then be &#8216;hove-to,&#8217; which is an almost stationary position adopted when
speaking another vessel or waiting for a boat, etc.&mdash;in this case for her Christmas
visitors.</p>

<p>I do not think any explanation will be necessary as to the presents. The
smaller ones, whatever they are, can be just mixed up together in the hold, and if
there are any of a superior character, they can be very well fixed in various places
in the rigging.</p>

<p>The Christmas ship in which I had a hand was well found in boats, anchors,
cannon, etc., all of which were distributed among the boys of the party. In
conclusion, I can only hope that, should you decide to build such a vessel, it may
prove a source of amusement to yourselves and gratification to your friends, and
no doubt very many will be only too anxious to learn when the good ship Santa
Claus is likely to arrive.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.&mdash;MODEL STEAM-ENGINES, AND HOW TO MAKE THEM.<br />
<span class="smcap">By Paul N. Hasluck</span>, Author of <i>Lathe-work</i>, &amp;c.</h3>

<h4>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Principles of the Steam-Engine.</span></h4>

<p class="noindent">This chapter is intended to fully describe the constructive details of miniature
steam-engines. It is proposed to first give an idea of the general principles which
govern steam-engines, and to explain the various characteristics and methods of constructing
different types of engines. The boiler and its several fittings and attachments
will be duly described, and then minute directions given for constructing
engines with oscillating and slide-valve cylinders. Illustrations of both vertical
and horizontal engines will be given, and also sketches in all cases where they will
serve to explain more fully the meaning of the text.</p>

<p>This is a brief outline of the scope of the present chapter. Those readers who
have acquired only slight manual dexterity in the use of tools will find little
difficulty in making the engines illustrated, if the instructions given are carefully
followed. In each case the minute details of the various processes incidental to
our engineering work will be carefully described, so that those unacquainted with
the mechanical arts will be able to comprehend the method of procedure.</p>

<p>Model engines, in every stage of manufacture, from the rough castings direct
from the foundry to the complete, highly-finished working model, may now be
purchased in nearly every town of importance throughout Great Britain. Though
this trade is of but recent growth, its continual extension proves that model engines
are objects of interest to a large number of the rising generation, and hence it is
felt that information as to their manufacture will prove acceptable to very many
readers.</p>

<p>It will be advisable to gain an insight into the principles which govern the
action of a steam-engine, and to learn some of the technical peculiarities, before
proceeding to attempt its manufacture. There are numerous text-books on the
steam-engine, which may be studied with advantage, and which show the theoretical
principles.</p>

<p>The modern engine, which now claims our attention, is the result of numerous
successive improvements. The application of steam as a motive power was
probably originally made by Hero, who, 150 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, constructed, or at least described,
an &AElig;olipile. This was a hollow sphere with hollow bent arms attached; when
water placed inside the sphere was heated, and steam generated, it issued from
the arms, and reacting on the air caused the sphere to rotate. A model of this,
the primogenitor of the modern steam-engine, can be bought at many opticians&#8217;
shops for about one shilling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The commencement of the eighteenth century began the first steps towards
the development of the modern form of engine. Savery and Newcomen made
improvements, which were perfected by James Watt, who was born at Glasgow in
1737. Amongst other valuable improvements he first contrived to convert the
reciprocating motion into a rotary one by means of the crank. In the year 1800
Watt retired from business, leaving the steam-engine in much the same condition
as we find it now. The application of steam-power for locomotion on both land
and water followed, and now stationary, locomotive, and marine engines, driven
by steam, are distributed all over the civilised world.</p>

<p>The varieties of model engines are in many cases indicated by their names.
Stationary engines are intended to be fixed, as those used for driving machinery.
Locomotives are those which are intended to travel by steam, and are self-moving.
Marine engines are those used to propel ships. Of these three classes we shall
deal only with the first and third in the present chapter. Locomotives are much
more complicated in their construction, and consequently are more difficult to
make.</p>

<p>Horizontal engines are those having the cylinder lying with its axis in a horizontal
position. Vertical engines have the cylinder upright; sometimes they are
designated by the latter adjective. Beam engines have an oscillating beam; one
end is connected to the piston and the other to a rod which drives the crank. Cylinders
are single-acting when the steam is admitted only at one end, and consequently
with these the crank is only propelled during half of its rotation. Double-acting
cylinders are provided with valves which admit the steam at each end of the cylinder
alternately. Oscillating cylinders are fitted to oscillate with the motion of the crank,
and the steam-valves are usually contrived to act by this oscillating motion. Slide-valve
cylinders have a sliding valve, worked by a rod connected to an eccentric on
the crank shaft, which opens the steam ports to alternately admit live steam and
exhaust at both ends of the cylinder. Slide-valve cylinders are invariably double-acting.</p>

<p>Boilers, which are the vessels in which water is converted into steam, are usually
described by their shape and position. They may be cylindrical, spherical, etc., and
horizontal or vertical. The construction also forms a distinguishing characteristic.
Tubes are usually inserted in the boiler to convey the heat from the fire. These
tubes&mdash;which are more properly called flues, especially in large boilers&mdash;vary in
number from one of large gauge to scores of small ones, thus naming the respective
boilers single-flue or multiflue. It may be advisable to mention here that <i>tubular</i>
boilers are those in which the water circulates in the tubes, and the fire impinges on
the outer surface. When the fire operates inside the tube it is called a <i>flue</i>. A tube
carries water; a flue carries flame and the volatile products of combustion.</p>

<p>Boilers, or steam generators, that are used to contain the water which, when
converted into steam, drives the engine, require to be sufficiently strong to withstand
an internal or bursting pressure. This pressure is very great in high-pressure engines,
but in models it is generally very low, and seldom exceeds twenty pounds to the
square inch. The evaporating capacity of the boiler is according to the requirements
of the engine it has to supply. The resistance of the piston to the steam shows the
pressure at which it should be supplied. Boilers are generally tested, by means of
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
hydraulic pump, to stand a pressure at least double that at which it is intended to
use them. It is unsafe to generate steam in any vessel that has not been properly
tested. This fact cannot be too strongly impressed upon the mind of the reader.</p>

<p>Suppose a double-action cylinder, 1-inch bore and 2-inch stroke, is to make one
hundred revolutions of the crank per minute, let us see how much steam will be
wanted to drive it. The area of the piston is &middot;785 inch, and each revolution of
the crank will require the cylinder to be filled twice&mdash;that is, one stroke in each
direction. This will take a column of steam &middot;785 inch in diameter and 4 inches
long for each revolution, or 314 cubic inches of steam per minute. If the speed
is greater, the quantity of steam must be increased proportionately; and when
running at the rate of one thousand revolutions per minute&mdash;a speed often attained&mdash;3,140
cubic inches of steam will be wanted to supply the cylinder. That is at
the rate of about 100 cubic feet per hour.</p>

<p>The pressure of the steam has not yet been taken into account, but it obviously
forms a most important factor in the calculation. Water in an open vessel boils at
a temperature of 212&deg; Fahr. Provided that the vessel allows the steam to escape
freely, all the heat that can be applied will only generate steam at the same pressure,
though it will escape faster. As the bubbles of steam ascend to the surface they
escape, having only the pressure of the atmosphere to overcome. When water is
confined in a closed vessel, like the boiler of a steam-engine, the temperature may
be raised to considerably above the usual boiling-point. The heat is always proportionate
to the pressure, and steam at a pressure of 120 lb. per square inch is equivalent
to the heat represented by 345&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p>A correct knowledge of the fact that pressure depends on temperature cannot be
urged too strongly on the mind of the model engineer. In many model boilers it is
quite impossible to raise the heat sufficiently to produce an adequate pressure.
Boiling water at 212&deg; Fahr. does not produce any available pressure of steam, it
merely counterbalances the weight of the atmosphere, which is 15 lb. to the square
inch. By increasing the heat, which can only be done in a closed vessel, available
pressure is obtained. Thus 228&deg; = 5 lb., 241&deg; = 10 lb., 251&deg; = 15 lb., and so on.
The steam, and the water from which it is generated, and with which it remains in
contact, have both the same temperature.</p>

<p>A cubic foot of water weighs 62&middot;5 lb., and it will produce 882 cubic feet of
steam, at a pressure of 15 lb. to the square inch above the normal atmospheric
pressure; this is equal to a temperature of 251&deg; Fahr. If the pressure is raised to
150 lb., which requires a temperature of 371&deg;, only 187 cubic feet of steam will be
produced. Steam is elastic, and hence the more it is compressed the greater will
be its force. If one cubic inch of steam, at a pressure of 30 lb., is admitted into a
cylinder, and the supply cut off when half filled, the steam will expand till it has
filled the cavity, and in increasing its bulk twofold its force will diminish in inverse
ratio. The pressure will therefore diminish to 15 lb. to the square inch. The
expansive force of steam is always at work on the piston of the engine, and it
varies in accordance with the arrangement of the valves.</p>

<p>Let us now trace the effect of the steam when admitted to the cylinder. When
the governor valve is opened the steam flows along the pipe to the slide valve
chest, and if one of the ports are open it reaches the cylinder. In traversing
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
pipes which conduct it to the cylinder the steam is cooled considerably and
its force diminished. In course of time the parts become heated to a certain
extent, and then the loss of power is less. When the steam enters the cylinder it at
once exerts a certain force on the piston. This has the effect of turning the crank
shaft, and in due course the slide valve closes the steam inlet. Now the steam
within the cylinder acts expansively, and continues to drive the crank shaft to the
end of the stroke. Then the exhaust port is opened, and allows the spent or dead
steam to escape. At the same time the inlet at the other end is opened and the
live steam rushes in and exerts its full pressure on the piston, causing it to travel in
the opposite direction. The opening and shutting of the steam ports is effected by
an eccentric on the crank shaft. In treating of the construction of these parts, the
relative sizes will be given and the correct motion explained.</p>

<h4>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A Simple Toy Engine.</span></h4>

<p>The most simple form of toy engine is that <a href="#FigIX01">illustrated</a> herewith. It consists of
a tin boiler, a single-action oscillating cylinder, and a fly-wheel. These parts are
sold ready for putting together at a very low price, and a complete engine may
be bought for a couple of shillings, though one of &#8216;superior make&#8217; at twice that
sum is by far a preferable investment.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span></p>
</div>

</div><!--figc520-->

<p>The <a href="#FigIX01">drawing</a> represents the most simple way of constructing a steam-engine,
and, if the workmanship is fairly good, a working model will be produced. First
is the boiler; a tin box 1<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. deep and 2 in. in diameter, will serve for this. The
joint at the side should be made by folding the edges of metal over each other, and
then soldering. The top and bottom are both soldered on their respective places,
steam-tight, of course. The top of the boiler must be provided with small bosses of
metal, soldered on the inner side, into which the pillar (<a href="#FigIX03">Fig. 3</a>) and the safety-valve
(<a href="#FigIX05">Fig. 5</a>) are screwed.</p>

<p>The tin plate is not sufficiently thick to afford a hold for the thread on the
pillar and valve. A disc of brass, say the size of a sixpence, and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. thick, is
soldered on the under side of the lid, and the holes, which are tapped to receive
the pillar and valve, are bored and threaded before the lid is fixed. By this means
a strong hold is secured for the fittings. The screw plug <span class="smcapall">A</span> (<a href="#FigIX01">Fig. 1</a>) is similarly
provided for. When each piece is screwed into its place a little hemp or cotton,
placed between the shoulder of the &#8216;fitting&#8217; and the surface of the tin plate, will
assist to ensure a steam-tight joint.</p>

<p>The standard or pillar is brass, about 2 in. long from end to end. Any form
may be given to it, according to fancy, the one shown in <a href="#FigIX02">Fig. 2</a> being perhaps as
good as any. The lower part is circular, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. in diameter, and it has a flat face on
one side, against which the valve face of the cylinder works. <a href="#FigIX03">Fig. 3</a> shows this.
The centre of the pillar is bored up in the middle of the screwed part to meet <i>one</i>
of the holes <i>a b</i>, it is immaterial which. The other hole is bored right through the
pillar to the opposite side, and forms the exhaust port, the one communicating with
the central hole in the pillar being the steam port. For the sake of distinction we
will suppose that <i>a</i> is bored into the central hole, and <i>b</i> is bored through the pillar;
then, when the pillar is screwed on to the boiler, and steam is generated, it issues
from the port hole <i>a</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The upper end of the pillar is bored through at right angles to the flat at the
bottom (see <a href="#FigIX02">Fig. 2</a>). Through the top a piece of brass tubing about <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. long is
fixed, generally by soldering; this is the bearing for the crank-shaft. The crank-shaft
itself is a piece of steel wire bent to the form required. The fly-wheel is fixed
to one end, and prevents the shaft coming out of the bearing, the bend of the arm
serving the same purpose at the other end.</p>

<p>The cylinder itself is shown at <a href="#FigIX03">Fig. 3</a>, and also in
<a href="#FigIX01">Figs. 1</a> and <a href="#FigIX02">2</a>. The piston,
piston-rod, and bearing which fits the crank-pin are shown in <a href="#FigIX04">Fig. 4</a>. It will be
evident that the dimensions of this engine are microscopic. The bore of the
cylinder is <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in., and the barrel itself is often made of triblet-drawn brass tube.
The enlarged part at the bottom is a casting with a flat face, as shown in <a href="#FigIX03">Fig. 3</a>, on
one side. Some makers use a casting for the entire cylinder, but the tube is perhaps
the cheaper method of making. A piece of good tube is sufficiently accurate in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
bore for use as bought, so that the trouble of boring the cylinder is dispensed with.
The base, for the tube to fit in, is bored to the external diameter, and the tube fixed
with solder. The lid or cover is fixed only by being snapped on. Its object is
only to guide the piston-rod.</p>

<p>A reference to <a href="#FigIX03">Fig. 3</a> will show the working of the oscillating valve. The face
of the pillar is shown on the right. On this, <i>a</i> is the hole from which the live steam
issues, and <i>b</i> is the exhaust hole. These holes are technically called ports. The
hole <i>c</i> is bored through the pillar, and takes the trunnion, or pin on which the
cylinder oscillates. <a href="#FigIX02">Fig. 2</a> shows this trunnion-pin prolonged and having a nut on
the end. A spiral spring around the trunnion, between the nut and the pillar, keeps
the valve face in close contact with the pillar face. Again, turning to <a href="#FigIX03">Fig. 3</a>, the
holes in the cylinder on the left are:&mdash;<i>c</i>, into which the trunnion is screwed; and <i>d</i>,
the steam-way.</p>

<p>When the cylinder is in the position shown in <a href="#FigIX01">Figs. 1</a> and <a href="#FigIX02">2</a>, the port-hole <i>d</i>
(<a href="#FigIX03">Fig. 3</a>) is over the solid metal between the holes <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. On turning the fly-wheel
the crank draws the piston out very slightly and inclines
the cylinder sideways, bringing the port <i>d</i> over <i>a</i>. The
live steam from the boiler at once enters and forces the
piston upwards, and on the crank reaching the highest
point the cylinder is again vertical and the hole <i>d</i> is mid-way
between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. The momentum of the fly-wheel
carrying the crank round brings the hole <i>d</i> opposite <i>b</i>, and
allows the steam to escape. There is no force to keep
the engine going during this part of the time except the
momentum of the fly-wheel. When the cylinder again
inclines to the opposite side <i>d</i> comes over <i>a</i>, and force is
again applied under the piston. This will keep the
engine going.</p>

<p>The single-action oscillating cylinder, being supplied with steam at one end
only, exerts power only during half the revolution of the crank. The return
stroke is dependent entirely on the momentum of the fly-wheel, which also has to
drive the steam out of the cylinder. Steam only acts in the lower part of the
cylinder, and as there is no power tending to force off the cover, it may be simply
snapped on like the lid of a pill-box. The piston, <a href="#FigIX04">Fig. 4</a>, has for its head a
disc of brass, with a <span class="lettsymb">V</span>-shaped groove in its edge. This is packed with hemp
or lamp cotton, to make it fit the cylinder steam tight. The rod is a steel wire
about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in. diameter; it is fixed in the piston by riveting, to save the trouble of
screwing. The end of the rod has a small piece of brass fixed on to it which fits on
the crank-pin.</p>

<p>The crank itself is all of one piece; a straight length forms the shaft; it is bent
at right angles to form the throw, and a piece bent from this, parallel to the shaft,
forms the pin. This is the most simple way of making a crank, and when large
quantities are made the wire is bent upon a template. A better type of crank is
made by using a steel rod for the shaft, a brass arm riveted on to it, and a steel pin
riveted into that. In the portion of this chapter devoted to the horizontal engine
will be found a more complete description of such a crank.</p>

<p>The safety-valve, <a href="#FigIX05">Fig. 5</a>, is very important as a safeguard in working. Though
they are sometimes omitted, yet safety-valves are essential for security. They allow
steam to escape from the boiler when the pressure exceeds a certain amount, and
thus the danger of an explosion is removed. The valve illustrated in
section has a spiral spring to keep the valve itself on its seat. This is
effective when the power of the spring has been definitely gauged, but
when the valves are put together haphazard no dependence can be placed
on the pressure at which the valve will blow off.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigIX05">
<img src="images/illo123.jpg" alt="steam engine" width="150" height="296" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The body of the valve is <span class="smcapall">A</span>, shown in section. <span class="smcapall">B</span> is the valve itself,
fitted to a rod, <span class="smcapall">D</span>; it rests on the conical seat of <span class="smcapall">A</span>, and is pressed down
by the spiral spring within the barrel of <span class="smcapall">A</span>. The body is screwed into
the boiler by the thread at the bottom, and the steam coming up the hole
<span class="smcapall">C</span> presses on the under side of the valve <span class="smcapall">B</span>. When the pressure of the
steam is sufficient to overcome the pressure of the spiral spring the valve is lifted
and the steam escapes through the holes <span class="smcapall">F F</span>. The cover <span class="smcapall">E</span> is screwed on the body
part and confines the spring; it has a hole through its centre to allow the valve-rod
<span class="smcapall">D</span> to pass. Especial attention should always be given to the safety-valve when heat
is to be applied to a boiler. See that the valve is not fixed to its seat or in any
way confined, or an explosion may follow the want of care.</p>

<p>The engine shown by the illustrations is usually mounted on a three-legged
stand, which raises it about two or three inches. A wire stand may be made according
to fancy, or perhaps some contrivance may be improvised to support the boiler at a
convenient height for applying the heat under it.</p>

<p>A small lamp burning methylated spirits&mdash;that is, spirits of wine&mdash;will supply the
requisite heat. It should have a clean and dry wick of lamp cotton; the size of
the flame may be regulated, to an extent, by the amount of wick which is drawn out.
The lamp must not be quite filled with spirit&mdash;about two-thirds full will be ample&mdash;and
thus the spirit will not be liable to overflow.</p>

<p>When charging the boiler it is best to use boiling water from a kettle. This will
save the time which would be lost in heating cold water with the spirit lamp. The
water is poured in through the water-plug hole, <span class="smcapall">A</span>, <a href="#FigIX01">Fig. 1</a>. The boiler must only be
filled to a little over half way. The plug is screwed in again and the lamp put
under; steam will be generated in due course, and if the fly-wheel is turned in the
right direction by hand for a few turns the engine will presently work of its own
accord.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say that the engine above described is of the most
simple kind, and every unnecessary detail is omitted. I will now proceed to describe
engines of a more elaborate character.</p>

<h4>III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Small Model Engines.</span></h4>

<p>Small model engines are composed mainly of brass castings and of steel which
requires no special forging for the purpose. The screws or bolts used to unite the
parts are usually purchased in a finished state. Makers of these employ machinery
which acts almost automatically, and the screws are sold at a very cheap rate.
Larger models require special forgings for the crank shaft, and the castings employed
are of iron, which is considerably cheaper than brass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The castings are made from patterns which are counterparts of the object required.
These are imbedded in sand, and leave a matrix, into which molten metal is poured,
producing, on solidifying, a facsimile of the pattern. The operation is always carried
out in a foundry, where the necessary furnaces and moulding appliances are at hand.
The founders charge for the rough castings by weight, and they cost merely a trifle
over the value of the metal. It is, however, necessary to supply the requisite patterns
before a founder can proceed to do his part of the work.</p>

<p>All vendors of castings have patterns from which their castings are moulded,
and of course they charge, in addition to a profit on the cost of the metal,
something for the use of the patterns. The patterns for a founder&#8217;s use require
certain modifications, which it is unnecessary to explain in detail. Some are made
in two or more parts, with pins to hold them together. Some have projections
affixed to them; these make prints in the mould to receive cores, which form holes
in the casting. Those patterns which enter deeply into the moulding sand are
made tapering, to draw out easily. In all cases they must be made sufficiently
large to allow for shrinkage in the metal. Ordinary iron castings shrink about
one-eighth of an inch to the foot; brass about half as much again. Pattern-makers
use a &#8216;contraction-rule&#8217; to work by; this is made longer than the standard
measurement, and patterns made according to it are the correct size to allow for
shrinkage.</p>

<p>From what has just been said it will be readily understood that vendors of
castings charge various prices for their goods. Nor in every case is the quality
in accordance with the price, and it is difficult to give the exact prices that should
be paid for good castings. Speaking generally, the price is regulated by the weight,
and the rate per pound is decided by the seller. In the catalogues issued by
various firms will be found the prices charged. As an example of the difference,
I notice that a certain size of bolts made by one firm are retailed by shopkeepers
at rates varying from 33 to 200 per cent. profit; the same rule probably holds good
in all other items.</p>

<p>Those readers who are not possessed of a lathe will not have the means of
finishing the cylinders and some other parts which have to be turned. These can,
however, be bought in various stages of completion, and the beginner who has
only a screwdriver may now purchase the component parts, and, having screwed
his engine together, he may claim some merit for his share in the erecting
department.</p>

<p>Sets of castings quite finished and ready to be screwed together are now sold.
These are generally of the cheaper class, and, tacked on cards, may be seen in the
windows of opticians. The prices for the complete engine, with boiler, lamp, and
all other parts, range from about five shillings upwards. A few words on the better
type of partially finished parts.</p>

<p>These castings are more expensive than those quite rough, but they afford an
opportunity of displaying considerable skill and judgment in completing them.</p>

<p>Boring the cylinders is the operation most likely to baffle the tyro. This is
done by vendors of castings for about two shillings and sixpence for cylinders
1-in. bore. This charge includes turning the flanges ready to receive the covers,
and also boring the steam-ways and cutting the port-holes. When all this has
been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
done it will be necessary to use a lathe to turn the covers for the cylinder, and also
for making the piston. The cylinder may be purchased complete with the covers
screwed on and the slide-valve fitted. One an inch in the bore costs half a guinea.
Every piece of an engine may be bought separately in a finished state, so that they
only require putting together, and when the young engineer has not the requisite
tools for doing the work his best plan will be to purchase the finished parts.</p>

<p>A glance at an engine will show that nearly every part of it has been fashioned
on a lathe. This tool is indispensable for all kinds of engineering work, but as it
is somewhat costly it frequently occurs that tyros are compelled to forego its
ownership and get the necessary turning executed by a professional latheman.
Those readers who are happily possessed of the king of tools&mdash;or the father of
mechanism, as the lathe has been aptly dubbed&mdash;will have the advantage of being
able themselves to execute the work throughout.</p>

<p>A few particulars of the different kinds of engines which a beginner may make,
will assist him in deciding as to the form and size best suited to his requirements.
An idea of the general forms and peculiarities of engines may be gleaned from
what has been already said. It is a matter entirely at the choice of the maker
whether he will build a vertical or a horizontal engine&mdash;whether it shall have
oscillating or slide-valve cylinders, and whether it shall be of microscopic dimensions
or a powerful model. All these points are for the consideration of the constructor,
and some hints will be of service to, and assist him in arriving at a useful result&mdash;that
is, the production of a working model.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the cylinder to an extent indicates the power; the pressure
of steam must also be considered. The friction in models is very great in proportion
to their size, and hence the very small ones are often barely able to generate sufficient
power to keep them going. The bore of the cylinder governs the area of the piston,
and this multiplied by the pressure of steam and the length of stroke gives the power
of the engine.</p>

<p>Let us compare the power of two small cylinders, one half-inch in bore and one-inch
in stroke, the other one-inch bore and two-inch stroke. We will suppose the
pressure of steam to be the same in both cases, viz., ten pounds to the square inch.
Speaking off-hand, many tyros would be apt to say that one cylinder was twice the
size of the other, and, as a natural deduction, twice the power. Comparison will at
once show the fallacy of the idea.</p>

<p>The area of the half-inch cylinder is nearly two-tenths of a square inch, that of
the other nearly eight-tenths. Thus we see that the larger one has four times the
area; also the length of stroke is twice as much. According to the rule given
above we find the power thus: <sup>2</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> &times; 10 &times;
1 = 2, and <sup>8</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> &times; 10 &times; 2 = 16. So that the
power of the larger cylinder is precisely eight times that of the small one. In every
case it is necessary to allow a certain percentage of the power to overcome friction.
The smaller the engine the greater will be the percentage lost in friction. These
simple facts will at once show that size is a most important consideration. If the
friction in the small engine was two pounds, the power would not drive it, whereas
if it were that much in the large one, there would still be fourteen pounds of available
power.</p>

<p>A cylinder 1<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-inch bore and the same length of
stroke, viz., 2 inches, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
give exactly double the power of the 1-inch bore cylinder just mentioned. If the
bore was increased to 2 inches, the power would be exactly four times that of the
1-inch bore, the length of stroke and pressure of steam remaining the same.</p>

<p>The velocity of the piston also forms a factor in calculating the power, which is
increased in the same proportion as the velocity. It will be readily understood that
when the pressure of the steam is constant, the speed of the engine will depend on
the amount of work it has to do. It must also be remembered that the pressure of
steam against the piston is by no means necessarily the same as it is in the boiler.
In passing from the boiler to the cylinder the steam pressure is always reduced, and
the greater the distance, and more exposed or tortuous the steam-pipe, the greater
will be the loss of pressure.</p>

<p>Every one knows that the power of steam-engines is given in &#8216;horse-power.&#8217;
This was a term originated by James Watt, and it is now universally adopted. The
mechanical equivalent is a lifting power that will raise 33,000 pounds 1 foot high in
one minute. On this estimate the power of an engine is calculated. The rule is
this: Multiply the pressure on the piston by velocity per minute and divide by
33,000. The velocity of the piston is twice the length of stroke in feet multiplied
by the number of revolutions per minute.</p>

<p>Let us calculate the horse-power of the 1 &times; 2 inch cylinder, already dealt with
at a pressure of 10 pounds, the speed being 100 revolutions per minute. By the
previous calculation we found that the pressure was 16 pounds. The velocity is
<sup>4</sup>&#8260;<sub>12</sub> &times; 100 = 33<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub>
(feet). Multiply these together, 16 &times; 33<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub> = 533<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub>, and divide
<sup>533</sup>&#8260;<sub>33000</sub> = &middot;016. That is, the engine is
<sup>16</sup>&#8260;<sub>1000</sub> of a horse-power, or capable of raising
528 pounds 1 foot high in one minute. That is supposing all the power was
available for <i>duty</i>. In large engines about 20 per cent. is allowed for friction, and
in the model we must allow at least 50 per cent. This at once reduces the calculated
power to half.</p>

<p>The <i>power</i> of an engine is the nominal, and the <i>duty</i> is the actual work that it
will perform. When the horse-power of an engine is spoken of it must be taken in
a qualified sense. By urging the furnace greater effect may be obtained, and by
keeping the furnace low an effect less than the nominal power is produced. <i>Duty</i>
is the term used to represent the amount of work absolutely done; it disregards the
size of the engine, and simply inquires how much work is done by a given expenditure
of fuel. True economy in working will add to the duty of an engine, whilst woful
waste in no way affects the power.</p>

<p>In order to supply the requisite quantity of steam, boilers should evaporate at
the rate of one cubic foot of water per hour per horse-power; that will produce
1700 cubic feet of free steam. The capacity of a boiler should be four or five times
as much as the water it boils off per hour, and the steam space should be at least
ten times as large as the consumption of steam at each stroke. The heating surface
should be from fifteen to twenty square feet per horse-power. Many circumstances
tend to modify these rules, but they maybe taken as fairly reliable.</p>

<h4>IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Horizontal Engine.</span></h4>

<p>Engines of the horizontal type are usually employed to furnish the power
required to drive fixed machinery in factories. The construction is simple, and the
form is adapted for fixing readily anywhere where a tolerably level foundation is to
be found.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigIX01a">

<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>

<p>The several illustrations given herewith are drawn to scale, and they will show at
a glance constructive details which could not well be explained in letterpress. <a href="#FigIX01">Fig. 1</a>
shows a plan view, and <a href="#FigIX02">Fig. 2</a> an elevation of the complete engine. In both
drawings the lettering is the same. The bed-plate <span class="smcapall">A A</span> is the foundation on which
the parts of the engine are fixed. A piece of sheet brass is used for small models,
but larger ones have cast-iron foundations. Cylinders 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
inches in the bore and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
upwards are usually mounted on iron bed-plates, the saving in cost of metal being
considerable when the castings are so large. Cast bed-plates have a moulded edge,
which adds both to their strength and appearance. Sheet metal has to be mounted
on columns sufficiently high to raise the fly-wheel above the ground-level.</p>

<p>The cylinder is shown in <a href="#FigIX01a">Figs. 1</a> and <a href="#FigIX02a">2</a> at <span class="smcapall">B</span>; at
<span class="smcapall">C</span> (in <a href="#FigIX01a">Fig. 1</a> only) is the steam-chest
containing the slide-valve. <span class="smcapall">D</span> is the fly-wheel fixed
on the shaft <span class="smcapall">E</span>, which has
at its opposite end the crank <span class="smcapall">F</span>. The piston-rod is
shown passing through a guide <span class="smcapall">G</span>
fixed to the bed by two screws. The connecting-rod from the piston to the crank-pin
is marked <span class="smcapall">H</span>. The eccentric is shown at <span
class="smcapall">I</span>, and the rod from it to the steam-chest
is the eccentric-rod. <span class="smcapall">J</span> <span class="smcapall">J</span>,
<a href="#FigIX02a">Fig. 2</a> only, show two screws which fix the cylinder
to the bed-plate. These references are sufficient to enable the inexperienced reader
to identify the principal parts of the engine. By carefully studying the drawings the
whole combination of the machine will be understood.</p>

<p>Each of the chief component parts which possess any intricacy of detail are
shown on a much larger scale. The description of each one may be taken as
generally applicable to engines of the type shown in <a href="#FigIX01a">Figs. 1</a> and <a href="#FigIX02a">2</a>. The dimensions
are suited to the size known as &#8216;<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch bore
and 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch stroke.&#8217; These measurements
refer to the cylinder. It will not be difficult to modify any of the minor
details to suit another size, whether it be larger or smaller.</p>

</div>

<p>A section of the cylinder is shown in <a href="#FigIX03a">Fig. 3</a>; the piston and its rod are absent,
to prevent confusion of the parts. The cylinder with the covers on is 2 inches long
and 1<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inches diameter across the flanges. The bore is
<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch and 1<sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inches (full)
long. The face of the cylinder where the valve works is level with the diameter of
the flanges. This face is shown at <a href="#FigIX04a">Fig. 4</a>, where the size and position of each porthole
may be seen. The rectangle represents the steam-chest itself, and the four
small circles are the screw-holes in the valve-face for attaching the steam-chest.</p>

<p>Returning to <a href="#FigIX03a">Fig. 3</a>, the steam-ways are shown at <span class="smcapall">A A</span>. These are drilled from
the ends to meet the inlet ports <span class="smcapall">B</span> and <span class="smcapall">C</span>, which are closed by the slide-valve (see
<a href="#FigIX05a">Fig. 5</a>). The exhaust way is at <span class="smcapall">D</span>, and the port-hole communicating with it needs
no special mention. The steam inlet is <span class="smcapall">E</span>; the threaded exterior is for attaching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
steam-pipe from the boiler. The glands and stuffing-boxes, for keeping the piston
and valve-rod steam-tight, are shown in section. <span class="smcapall">G</span> <span class="smcapall">G</span> are the glands screwed into
the castings; the parts bored out to receive the packings are marked <span class="smcapall">H</span> <span class="smcapall">H</span>. It will
not be necessary to make special reference to the body of the cylinder, the covers,
&amp;c., as the reader will have become acquainted with these in the previous chapters.</p>

<p>By reference to <a href="#FigIX03a">Fig. 3</a> the passage of the steam may be traced. It enters at <span class="smcapall">E</span>,
filling the steam chest, and as the valve is shown it could find no outlet. The valve
on being moved would uncover one port, say <span class="smcapall">B</span>, and allow the steam to enter by the
steam-way <span class="smcapall">A</span>, through the slot filed in the edge. When in the cylinder it would
force the piston towards the bottom, the action of the eccentric meanwhile pushing
the valve along and further opening <span class="smcapall">B</span>. When the piston had made half its stroke
the valve would commence to close again, and by the time the end was reached the
valve would be again in the position shown. The momentum of the fly-wheel would
carry round the eccentric, and with it the valve would move so as to open the way
from <span class="smcapall">B</span> to <span class="smcapall">D</span>, thus allowing the steam in the cylinder to escape. The port-hole <span class="smcapall">C</span>
would also be opened to
the live steam, which
would then exert its pressure
on the lower side of
the piston. By the motion
of the valve the steam is
let into <span class="smcapall">B</span> and <span class="smcapall">C</span> alternately,
and thus the reciprocating
motion of the piston is
maintained.</p>

<p>The slide-valve is shown
at <a href="#FigIX05a">Fig. 5</a>, where <span class="smcapall">A</span> is a view
of the face. The centre is
hollowed out, as shown at
<span class="smcapall">B</span> of the section, to allow
the steam to pass into the exhaust. The back is shown at <span class="smcapall">C</span>; the saw-cut receives
the valve-rod, which is thinned down to fit it. The face of the valve, that is, all
the outer part of <span class="smcapall">A</span>, is made perfectly flat, to fit steam-tight on the valve face of the
cylinder. Contact is ensured by the pressure of the live steam in the steam-chest;
this is always more than that of the exhaust.</p>

<p>The crank-shaft, marked <span class="smcapall">E</span> in <a href="#FigIX01a">Fig. 1</a>,
is shown alone full size at <a href="#FigIX06a">Fig. 6</a>. This is
a rod of round steel <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch in diameter, the
total length is 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inches. At the right-hand
end it is reduced in size a length of <sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch, to receive the fly-wheel and
the driving pulley. These are generally screwed on to a thread cut on the shaft, but
wedging is a more workmanlike way of securing driving wheels and pulleys. The
two journals are to rest in the bearings shown at <a href="#FigIX07a">Fig. 7</a>; the neck at the left-hand
end is to receive the crank-arm. The collars on the shaft outside of each journal
are of the widths shown. One of the bearings for the crank-shaft is shown at <a href="#FigIX07a">Fig. 7</a>.
<span class="smcapall">A</span> is a side view, <span class="smcapall">B</span>
an edge view, and <span class="smcapall">C</span> a view from the top; in this the dotted lines
represent the screw-heads. These bearings are usually brass castings; they are fixed
on the bed-plate by two screws each, and the cap is also held on by two other
screws.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Various designs may be obtained, but the one illustrated is as good as any. The
thickness of the bearing is nearly <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch. The height must be precisely that which
will bring the centre of the crank-shaft level with the centre of the piston-rod.</p>

<p><a href="#FigIX08a">Fig. 8</a> is the crank-arm, giving an end and side view. It should be made of
steel and fixed on the shaft by keying, though more often it is screwed on. The
thickness is shown about <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>; the shape may be according to fancy. The hole at the
bottom is for the crank-pin, which is riveted in. The &#8216;throw&#8217; of the crank is an
important point, and it must never be so much that the piston touches the ends of
the cylinder. In the present case the &#8216;throw,&#8217; that is, the distance from the
centre of the crank-shaft to the centre of the crank-pin, is <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch. This gives
1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch stroke; there is plenty of
space in the cylinder for another <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>
inch, and possibly the nominal stroke,
1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches, could be managed by
using a thin piston-head. The crank-pin
is shown at the top of <a href="#FigIX10a">Fig. 10</a>.</p>

<p>The guide-block, <a href="#FigIX09a">Fig. 9</a>, serves

<p><a href="#FigIX10a">Fig. 10</a> shows the crank-pin and

The crank-pin is steel,
<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch diameter, turned down to

which is riveted into the arm (<a href="#FigIX08a">Fig. 8</a>).
The head of the rod is fitted with a
cap, held by two screws, so that it
may be placed over the crank-pin
into the groove. The other end of the rod, which is forked, is shown at <a href="#FigIX11a">Fig. 11</a>.
Here a section and elevation are given; the round piece, called the cross-head,
which receives the two screws (see section), is bored to fit the piston-rod, and it
is clamped to this by the points of the screws shown. The sides of the fork are
bored to fit freely over the threads of the screws, so that it may oscillate with the
motion of the crank. The position of the cross-head on the piston is determined
when the engine is together; it is placed so that the piston slides midway between
the ends of the cylinder.</p>

<p><a href="#FigIX12a">Fig. 12</a> shows the eccentric and the eccentric strap. The first is a piece of
brass; the large circle has a groove turned in it to receive the strap, and the boss is
eccentric, as shown in the left-hand figure. The amount of eccentricity is
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
which gives a travel of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch to the slide-valve. These eccentrics are turned on a
mandrel having double centres, one pair serving when turning the boss, and the other
when turning the eccentric itself. A set-screw tapped through the boss serves to
secure it on the crank-shaft.</p>

<p>The strap on the right of <a href="#FigIX12a">Fig. 12</a> is cast in the form shown, the centre is bored to
fit the groove in the eccentric, and the strap then cut in halves through the lugs.
These lugs serve to take screws, which hold the strap together. The projecting
piece on the right is to receive the eccentric rod, which is screwed into the strap
at this point.</p>

<p>This completes the description of the various parts of a model horizontal
engine. A glance at <a href="#FigIX01a">Figs. 1</a> and <a href="#FigIX02a">2</a> will show the relative position of each.</p>

<h4>V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Oscillating Engine.</span></h4>

<p>Herewith are drawings of an engine with an oscillating cylinder. This form of
construction economises space and weight; it is also more simple than slide-valve
cylinders. In all oscillating engines the cylinder is mounted on trunnions or gudgeons,
so that it may swing to and fro through a small arc, and allow the piston-rod
to follow the motion of the crank. No connecting-rod is required in this engine, the
piston-rod being attached direct to the crank-pin.</p>

<p>The <a href="#FigIX01b">illustration</a> shows an engine specially adapted for propelling a model boat.
The entire machine is kept low down, which is generally necessary for small
boats. The fly-wheel is shown much heavier than are those attached to toyshop
engines, but it is not unnecessarily large. Experiments show that a weighty fly-wheel
is required on an engine which has the constant drag of a screw propeller
to overcome. This fact is ignored by some makers of engines, and I have known
cases where a useless engine has been made effective by the substitution of a
much heavier fly-wheel. (See <a href="#Page_132">page 132</a>.)</p>

<p>The framework on which the cylinder is mounted, and which also generally
serves to carry the bearings for the driving shaft, may be of almost any design.
There is no set pattern for this purpose, and it rests with the designer to fashion
his pattern according to fancy. The <a href="#FigIX01b">form shown</a> possesses the essential characteristics.
It is strong, yet light; there is a good base by which to secure the
engine to the hull of the boat. Suitable provisions are made for the bearings of
the crank-shaft, also for the valve-face and the cylinder trunnion. So long as these
are provided for, the mere contour is of little importance.</p>

<p><a href="#FigIX01b">Fig. 1</a> gives a side elevation, and <a href="#FigIX02b">Fig. 2</a> an end view of the same engine. The
cylinder is 1 in. bore and 1 in. stroke. The length without covers is 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in., that
allows <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. for thickness of piston,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in. for each of the projections of the two
covers, and the same distance left vacant at each end. The diameter of the cylinder
across the flanges is 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in., and a semicircular rib is shown in the middle. Each
cover is held on by six hexagon-headed bolts, placed equidistant round it, tapped
into the flange. These bolts are not shown in the lower cover.</p>

<p>The piston-rod is shown out from the cylinder to its fullest extent. The rod is
of round steel <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. diameter. The crank-pin head is of brass screwed on to the
end of the rod. Though shown as a solid piece, it would be better if this
head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
was cut across horizontally at the diameter of the crank-pin, and the cap secured
by two screws. The crank-pin is marked <span class="smcapall">E</span>. It is steel riveted into the disc which
forms the crank. A crank-arm would do equally well, and the disc is shown simply
as illustrating a different plan. The disc <span class="smcapall">F</span> is fixed on the crank-shaft either by
screwing, by a transverse pin, or by a key.</p>

<p>The crank-shaft is <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. steel, and should be turned smooth and parallel to fit
the hole in the standard. This hole should also be smooth and parallel, which it
will be if properly bored with a suitable tool. A long bearing has no more friction
than a short one, though a contrary opinion seems to be prevalent. A small hole
for supplying the oil necessary for lubrication should be made near the middle of
this bearing. The same remarks apply to the bearing <span class="smcapall">H</span> through which the
trunnion passes.</p>

<p>The fly-wheel is marked <span class="smcapall">A</span> in <a href="#FigIX01">Fig.
1</a>; it is cast-iron, 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches in diameter and
<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. wide on the rim. The rim should be half an inch
thick at least, and the boss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
in the centre as wide as the rim. If bored fairly true, the casting need not be
turned on its edge, though it will look better if bright. A small key should be used
to fix the fly-wheel on the shaft. This latter, shown broken off in the drawing,
projects slightly, and carries a small disc with two pins, which engage in a fork on
the end of the propeller shaft and so drive it, and the screw is attached to its end.</p>

<p>The valve-face of the standard, <span class="smcapall">B</span>, <a href="#FigIX01">Fig. 1</a>. must be made perfectly flat and at
right angles to the boring for the crank-shaft <span class="smcapall">C</span>. <a href="#FigIX03">Fig. 3</a> shows the face of this
standard as it would be seen in <a href="#FigIX02">Fig. 2</a> if the cylinder was removed. It is convenient
to turn the valve-face in the lathe, and
at the same time cut the circular groove, which,
after being stopped by plugging at both top
and bottom, forms the supply and exhaust
ports respectively. The face may be made
flat by filing when a lathe is not available, and
the groove cut by means of a circular cutter.
This is an annular bit with teeth on its edge,
which cut a channel but do not touch the
inner part.</p>

<p>Through the centre of the valve-face a hole
is bored to receive the cylinder trunnion.
This trunnion, <a href="#FigIX04">Fig. 4</a>, is a steel pin screwed
into the valve-face of the cylinder (see <a href="#FigIX03">Fig. 3</a>,
section of cylinder showing valve-face and
steam-ways). The outer end is threaded for
a nut, <span class="smcapall">D</span>; this has a washer beneath it, and
keeps the cylinder close against the standard,
with the faces of the valves held together
steam-tight, yet so that the cylinder may oscillate
freely. A spiral spring beneath the nut is
sometimes used, but in good work the adjustment
is made with a pair of lock-nuts. The
hole through the standard must be perfectly at
right angles to the face, and the trunnion in
the cylinder must also be perpendicular to the
valve-face, or the two faces cannot come
together steam-tight.</p>

</div>

<p>The stuffing-box, 1, of the piston is made
with a gland drawn down on the packing by two screws. This arrangement is
shown in section at <a href="#FigIX05">Fig. 5</a>. The method of fitting the gland, whether by screwing
direct into the boss of the cylinder cover, as shown at the right in <a href="#FigIX05">Fig. 5</a>, or by
screws tapped through the flange, as in the left-hand illustration, is quite optional.
By referring to <a href="#FigIX05">Fig. 5</a>, the construction of the two forms of stuffing-boxes will be
understood. The gland belonging to each is shown separate immediately above
the sections. The same lettering is used in both. <span class="smcapall">A</span> is the cylinder cover, with the
projecting boss into which the gland <span class="smcapall">B</span> is fitted. The space for the stuffing or
packing is marked <span class="smcapall">C</span>. This is filled with lamp cotton, and
when the gland is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
screwed down the cotton is compressed, so that it makes a steam-tight fitting for the
piston-rod to slide in. The hole for the piston-rod is shown through the centres
of both sections. As before explained, the gland on the left is secured by two
screws shown in the section; it is fitted into a plain cylindrical hole. The other
gland is threaded to screw direct into the cylinder cover, which is tapped to receive
it. The first method is the one always employed in large engines. The screwed
gland has a milled edge, so that it may be
turned with the thumb and finger.</p>

<p>The action of the valves in a double-action
oscillating cylinder will be best explained by
reference to <a href="#FigIX03">Fig. 3</a>. This shows the face of
the standard and the section of the cylinder.
There is a flat face to the cylinder, usually
circular; this has the two steam-ways <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>,
bored in it. These holes meet others, drilled
from the ends of the cylinder, parallel with its
bore, and conduct the steam to the ends of the
cylinder through the passages at <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>. On the
face of the standard are two holes <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
drilled from the back, one to receive the steam
from the boiler, the other to take the exhaust
pipe. These holes are not bored through, but
communicate with the circular groove <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>.
This groove is stopped at <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>. The
cylinder is placed against the standard and
held close to it, as shown in <a href="#FigIX01">Fig. 1</a>, by means
of the trunnion illustrated by <a href="#FigIX04">Fig. 4</a>.</p>

<p>When the cylinder is vertical, as shown in
<a href="#FigIX02">Fig. 2</a>, the port-holes are opposite the solid
part of the face <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>. Suppose live steam
issues from <i>a</i> and fills <i>c</i>, directly the cylinder
is moved on one side and one of the port-holes
comes over the groove <i>e</i>, the steam enters the
cylinder and, pressing against the piston,
compels the crank to revolve. By the same
motion the other port is uncovered into <i>d</i>, and the dead steam escapes. When
the cylinder again reaches a vertical position the steam-ports are again closed,
but the momentum of the fly-wheel carries it over the dead centre, and then the
positions of the ports are reversed. The one formerly over the exhaust now opens
to the live steam and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Thus the steam is admitted alternately at both
sides of the piston, and so the engine continues to work.</p>

<h4>VI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Model Boilers and their Construction.</span></h4>

<p>A few words on model boilers and their construction will now be advisable. They
have been mentioned several times incidentally in the course of these sections, but,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>with
the exception of the small tin boiler for the oscillating engine first described,
particulars of their construction have been omitted. It is not an easy task making
a steam boiler, and in most cases it will be found cheapest in the end to purchase
ready made.</p>

<p>The materials most generally used are brass and copper; sometimes iron, or
what amounts to the same thing, tin-plate, is employed. Brass or copper, from the
ease with which they can be manipulated, are the best for a beginner to work on.</p>

<p>Brass can be bought in the form of tube of sufficient size for small models, and
strong enough to stand the steam pressure. The edges of the bought tube are brazed
together, and thus the joint is made nearly as strong as the other part. The tube
is afterwards drawn, and, except from a slight discoloration, the joint is not
noticeable.</p>

<p>Brass tube, from two inches to six inches in diameter, cut in lengths suited for
boilers, is sold by most of the model engineers. The price of the tube ranges from
about 2<i>s.</i> per foot for the small to about 10<i>s.</i> per foot for the large size; the short
length necessary for a boiler being charged at about the same proportion. This is
merely for the tubular body part of the boiler, and it may be placed vertically or
horizontally as required.</p>

<p>The ends or flanges which have to be fitted on are extra pieces. Sometimes a
plain disc of metal is fixed by soldering with pewter; but this plan should be
strenuously avoided. The ends should at least be brazed on. It is best also to
use discs with a rim round them to fit over the boiler tube. This gives a much
stronger hold than is possible with a plain disc of sheet metal.</p>

<p>Castings used for the boiler ends must be quite free from any flaws, or the weak
part will be apt to give way under the steam pressure. It is often advisable to use
castings, which may be made of a shape exactly suited to certain requirements.
An inverted cup-shaped casting for the lower end of a vertical boiler gives a good
heating surface. A flue for the chimney must be put in it, and this goes up to the
top end of the boiler, which may appropriately be dome-shaped.</p>

<p>The flue and both ends of the boiler should be brazed in their places, not soft-soldered.
Some prefer to use silver solder for such purposes, and this is an excellent
material. When the joints are made to fit properly, as they should do before
soldering, only very little solder is required to unite the parts. Borax is used as the
flux, both for the alloy employed in brazing and for silver solder. The heat required
to flow these properly may be got from an ordinary gas jet, with the burner or nipple
removed, using a common blow-pipe to urge the flame.</p>

<p>A horizontal boiler is frequently only a plain tube, with the ends soldered in, and
supported on legs to raise it sufficiently to allow a lamp to be put underneath. The
heat applied in this manner does not take effect as it should. The flame is deflected
from the surface of the boiler, and, moreover, any breath of wind stirring will blow
the flame aside. A plain saddle-shaped boiler is much better; in this form the
heating surface is large, and the heat from the furnace is applied to it direct, and
cannot well be deflected.</p>

<p>Flues or tubes are very desirable in any form of boiler, and one or the other
should be used. The plain straight chimney put through the boiler is the most
simple form of flue. If this is of spiral form, like a corkscrew, the effect is infinitely
increased, because the heat, instead of ascending straight up through the
vertical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
tube, is met at every turn with a fresh surface of metal. In winding its way through
a spiral tube, the heat is absorbed in a way quite unattainable when a straight tube
is used. Several small tubes are of course better than one large one of the same
area. By increasing the number of flues the cost of making a boiler is also increased,
and it is to save expense that large flues are used.</p>

<p>Boilers for locomotives, which are required to make steam very fast, have an
immense number of tubes running through them. The space between the tubes,
which is occupied by the water, is often very small, and in fact the tubes are put as
closely together as possible. As the heat rushes through them it is absorbed by the
water in contact with the tube, and turns it into steam. The greater the heating
surface the more readily is the steam generated.</p>

<p>Tubes are often put across the fire-grate; they are then called cross-tubes. Two,
placed one above the other and crossing each other, will give a large amount of
heating surface. By adding this simple contrivance to a vertical boiler with a
straight flue it may be made to give off much more steam. One or two cross-tubes
generally suffice to convert a useless boiler, that is, one that will not generate
enough steam, into an effective one.</p>

<p>The fuel used to heat small boilers is generally spirits of wine. This is put in a
suitable receptacle and burnt through a cotton wick. Several wicks are used in
large boilers, and they are placed to heat the largest surface available. Spirit lamps
are a source of danger if proper precautions are not taken. Unless there is a free
outlet for the air within the lamp, it will be expanded by the heat and cause the
spirit to rise too quickly in the wick. Sometimes it will overflow, and then it
burns wherever it may be. Care must therefore be exercised in using spirit fuel.
In model boats it occasionally happens that the spirit overflows, and the boat is all
ablaze. An iron tea-tray, or some such utensil, should be used to stand the boiler
on when the furnace is to be lighted.</p>

<p>Charcoal is a better fuel, when there is sufficient space in the fire-box to contain
a supply. The waste steam from the cylinder must always be conveyed to the
chimney and escape up it to make a draft through the fire. Without this it cannot
be made to burn sufficiently fierce for the purpose. A charcoal fire will act very
well, with a little attention, and except for the smallest engines it is always preferable
to methylated spirit.</p>

<p>As it is not possible to give any adequate instructions on boiler-making in the
limited space at my disposal, the above hints are chiefly intended for the guidance
of purchasers.</p>

<p>A safety valve should always be fitted to a steam boiler. One of the spring
valves has been <a href="#FigIX05">illustrated</a> in the chapter treating of the small oscillating engine.
The lever safety valve is more certain in its action, especially in model work, and is
better adapted for stationary purposes. A weighted lever is of no use to a locomotive
or marine boiler, as the motion of travelling would disarrange the gear. The
safety valve of every engine should be tested frequently, to make sure that it does
not stick in its place and that all works perfectly free.</p>

<p>A glass gauge, by which the height of water may be seen at a glance, is frequently
attached to boilers having any pretension to high-class workmanship.
There is a good deal of work in a properly made gauge, and the cost is
correspondingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
high. Two or three stop-cocks are required in a gauge, and these
involve good workmanship, or they will not stand the pressure. Leaky taps are a
sign of inferior work.</p>

<p>Gauge cocks are sometimes used instead of the water gauge just mentioned.
These are plain taps with straight noses. Two are wanted on a boiler; they are
screwed in, one at high-water and the other at low-water level. By turning on
these taps it is easy to see whether the water is within these limits; but the precise
height cannot be ascertained. The gauge-glass is therefore much preferable.</p>

<p>Whistles are fitted to boilers only as ornaments. They are quite useless as
signals, except such as can be given by word of mouth, are not required in working
model engines. These attachments are made to sound by allowing the steam to
act as the breath does in common whistles.</p>

<p>Force-pumps are used to force water into the boiler to make up for that converted
into steam, and conveyed through the cylinder. These pumps are actuated
by an eccentric on the crank-shaft, and, at every revolution of the crank, throw a
small quantity of water into the boiler. When we consider how much water is
evaporated to make the quantity of steam used for each revolution of the cylinder,
we may arrive at an idea of the work required of a force pump. Practically the
water to be injected at each stroke is too small to be dealt with, unless a large
cylinder has to be supplied. The only way to work a force pump for a model
satisfactorily is by gearing, so that a stroke of the plunger is performed about once
to each hundred revolutions of the crank.</p>

<p>A better plan for feeding small boilers is by hand. The force pump is attached
to the boiler in the usual way, but not connected to the engine. The plunger is
worked by a hand lever, and when it is seen that water is wanted in the boiler, a
few strokes of the lever will suffice.</p>

<p>Governors are used to control the speed of the engine. Without any such
contrivance the engine runs at a speed corresponding to the work it has to do.
The heavier the load the slower the speed, and immediately that the load is decreased
the speed increases. A governor consists of a pair of balls, which are
attached to arms pivoted to an axis revolved by the engine. The faster the speed
the greater is the centrifugal force of the balls, and by connecting these with a
valve, called a throttle valve, in the steam pipe, the supply of steam is reduced as
the speed increases. By this means a uniform rate of speed is attained, irrespective
of the steam pressure or the duty demanded of the engine.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.&mdash;THE &#8216;BOY&#8217;S OWN&#8217; MODEL LAUNCH ENGINE.<br />
<span class="smcap">By H. F. Hobden.</span></h3>

<div class="figleft" id="FigX00">
<img src="images/illo138.jpg" alt="launch engine" width="300" height="362" />
</div>

<p class="noindent">I propose in this chapter to give a few practical hints showing how to build a
perfect model of an inverted-cylinder direct-action engine with link-motion reversing
gear, like the <a href="#FigX00">sketch</a> below, which represents a type in daily use on the river and
sea. Such a model, having a fixed cylinder, has not the friction of other types, and
therefore it gives more power, size for size, than an oscillating engine, and does not
get so easily out of order.</p>

<p>You must of course have a lathe, which I will therefore suppose you to possess;
but should there not be a slide-rest to it, you must get the cylinder bored by a
professional turner, for which he will charge
about two shillings, according to the size
of your castings.</p>

<p>Let me first briefly explain the action of
the steam in the engine by a diagram (<a href="#FigX01">Fig. 1</a>,
p. 139). The cylinder <span class="smcapall">A</span> is bolted into the
standard, <span class="smcapall">B</span>; the ports or steam-passages are
shown at <span class="smcapall">C</span>; and the slide-valve that allows
the steam to pass alternately to each side
of the piston is marked <span class="smcapall">D</span>, in its case <span class="smcapall">F</span>.
<span class="smcapall">G</span> <span class="smcapall">G</span> are the stuffing-boxes, which have to
be packed with lamp-cotton greased to make
them steam-tight, <span class="smcapall">H</span> is the piston, with its
rod finishing in a cross-head <span class="smcapall">J</span>, which is cut
with a groove to slide up and down the
standards to guide it and prevent the piston-rod
being bent out of shape. <span class="smcapall">K</span> shows the
connecting-rod, attached at its lower end
to the crank <span class="smcapall">L</span>. <span class="smcapall">M</span> is one of the eccentrics
working the slide-valve. <span class="smcapall">N</span> is the main
shaft, resting on the plummer blocks <span class="smcapall">O</span> <span class="smcapall">O</span>,
having a heavy fly-wheel at <span class="smcapall">P</span> and the coupler at
<span class="smcapall">Q</span>. <span class="smcapall">R</span> is the top cylinder plate,
drilled to screw in the grease-cock, of which I will presently give a drawing on an
enlarged scale, <span class="smcapall">S</span> is the bed-plate,
<span class="smcapall">T</span> the steam supply, and <span class="smcapall">X</span> the exhaust.</p>

<p>You will observe that the steam is coming in at the top of the cylinder, through
the top port, as shown by the arrow, pressing the piston down and allowing the
waste steam that has already raised the piston to escape through the lower port, and
so into the exhaust. By that time the slide-valve is raised (by the eccentric)
sufficiently to cut the steam off from the top port, which by that means is in its
turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
put in communication with the exhaust, and allows the steam to pass out of the top
part of the cylinder, whilst it admits it to the lower portion, and so on alternately.</p>

<p>And now to the practical work. After having the cylinder bored, as already
mentioned, get a piece of oak or other hard wood 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch square and about 6 inches
long. Turn one end of it in the lathe, so that it fits the inside of cylinder, and drive
it on. Then put it in the lathe again, and turn the flanges <span class="smcapall">A</span> (<a href="#FigX02">Fig. 2</a>) down, and be
very careful that they are quite true
and square.</p>

</div>

</div><!--figc585-->

<p>The top and bottom cylinder-covers,
with the stuffing-box, come
next. Screw a piece of hard wood
on the end of your lathe mandrel,
turn it down to about a quarter of
an inch less in diameter than the
flanges of your cylinder, make a
small hole for the stuffing-box to be
driven in, as in <a href="#FigX03">Fig. 3</a>. You can
now turn the edge and side&mdash;that
next the cylinder. The projecting
part <span class="smcapall">A</span> is to be the exact size of the
diameter of cylinder. When this is
done, take it out and place it in
another chuck, and drill and turn
the stuffing-box out, and screw it to
receive the gland (<a href="#FigX04">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<p>Now chuck the top cover and
turn it down to size. The piston is
a casting, and has to be turned in
the lathe to fit the cylinder, and a
groove run round it to hold the
greased cotton to make it steam-tight.
Whilst in the lathe drill a
hole in the centre, and tap it to receive
the piston-rod, which you can
make out of steel wire. Then pass
one end through the stuffing-box on
cylinder-cover and screw it on the
cross-head <span class="smcapall">J</span> (<a href="#FigX01">Fig. 1</a>), having first
filed it up quite square and true and
finished it off with emery. Now
take the standards <span class="smcapall">B</span> (<a href="#FigX01">Fig. 1</a>), and finish them up with a file in the same way, and
be careful that the insides forming the guides for cross-heads are quite true. We
can now make the lagging for cylinder. Get a piece of mahogany the length
of the outside circumference of cylinder and the width of the distance between
flanges of same. Then plane it down to about an eighth of an inch and score
it with a penknife every eighth of an inch down its width; it will then bend
round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the cylinder, and you can fasten it on by a couple of brass bands, screwing the
ends down near the slide-valve case.</p>

<p>We will next tackle the steam-ports in the cylinder <span class="smcapall">B</span> (<a href="#FigX02">Fig. 2</a>). They are
simply two holes drilled side by side until they reach the openings
<span class="smcapall">C</span> <span class="smcapall">C</span> (<a href="#FigX02">Fig. 2</a>) in the
casting; they must not be drilled any farther.</p>

<p>Now place the ends on cylinder and drill through them so as to screw them on
to the flanges. The slide-valve case is a casting with separate lid (<a href="#FigX05">Fig. 5</a>), and has
to be faced up with a file, and four holes drilled through the lid and corners to screw
on to the cylinder face. The boss on lid must now be drilled and tapped for steam-pipe
to be screwed in.</p>

<p>The slide-valve itself is like <a href="#FigX06">Fig. 6</a>, has a hollow cast in its face, and a small projection
on the back
(<span class="smcapall">B</span>), which you must
make a narrow groove
in with a saw, and
file the end of the
valve-rod down to fit
it, as shown at <span class="smcapall">C</span>,
<a href="#FigX06">Fig. 6</a>.</p>

<p>The face of the
cylinder and also of
the slide-valve must
now be made to work
steam-tight by rubbing
on a perfectly
flat stone until true,
and then putting
some emery and oil
on a board and working
them up until
they are quite true.</p>

<p>The eccentrics
may now receive attention.
They will
require to be chucked twice, and the true centre marked. Do not drill it out
yet, as the hole for the crank-shaft must not be in the centre, but half the travel
of the slide valve from the centre. For instance, if the valve travelled one inch
you would have to drill hole for shaft half an inch out of true centre of eccentric.</p>

<p>The straps (<a href="#FigX07">Fig. 7</a>) have to be turned quite true to the size of the groove on
eccentrics, then taken out of lathe and cut through line <span class="smcapall">A B</span> with a fine saw, and
screwed together at <span class="smcapall">C</span> <span class="smcapall">C</span>.
A hole has now to be drilled at <span class="smcapall">D</span> and tapped for the
eccentric rods to be screwed into, one of which will have to be bent like <a href="#FigX08">Fig. 8</a>, so as
to allow it to work on to the quadrant. It is the neatest way to key the eccentrics
on to the shaft with a small steel wedge.</p>

<p>The quadrant (<a href="#FigX09">Fig. 9</a>) is of brass, and will have to be finished up with a file and
emery, and the holes <span class="smcapall">A</span> <span class="smcapall">B</span>
<span class="smcapall">B</span> drilled through. The shaft ought to be turned up in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
lathe as well as the fly-wheel and coupler, with a slight groove sunk in where the
plummer blocks support it, so as to take the thrust.</p>

</div>

<p>The reversing quadrant with the lever attached I have shown at <a href="#FigX10">Fig. 10</a>. It is
best cut out of brass. The notches are cut with a small file after the two pieces
have been brazed together with a small piece an eighth of an inch thick between
either end. It is then screwed on to the slide-valve case.</p>

<p>The lever is drilled at <span class="smcapall">A</span>, <span class="smcapall">B</span>,
and <span class="smcapall">C</span> with small holes, and can be made of flat steel
wire; <span class="smcapall">A</span> is for a pin to work into a joint or hinge on
bed-plate. <span class="smcapall">B</span> is attached to the
hole <span class="smcapall">A</span> (<a href="#FigX09">Fig. 9</a>) by a small length of brass rod, so as to work easily. Cut with a slot
at each end and then drill like <a href="#FigX11">Fig. 11</a>.</p>

<p>The small spring <span class="smcapall">D</span> (<a href="#FigX10">Fig. 10</a>) is to keep the ratchet down in place, and is best
made from a watch-spring, and the handle <span class="smcapall">F</span> is turned out of some brass wire.</p>

<p>The different-size drills you will require can be easily made from various steel
knitting-needles warmed, filed up to shape, and then tempered to a light-straw
colour.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigX12">
<img src="images/illo141c.jpg" alt="launch engine" width="200" height="323" />
<p class="caption">FIG 12</p>
</div>

<p>We now come to the grease or oil cocks, which I have mentioned before. They
can be bought ready finished at most model shops, but for those who like to
make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
everything for themselves, this is the way to proceed. <a href="#FigX12">Fig. 12</a> is a section showing
interior oil chamber that allows the cylinder to be oiled without stopping the engine
by turning off cock <span class="smcapall">A</span> and opening cock
<span class="smcapall">B</span>, then filling with oil; then shutting <span class="smcapall">B</span> and
opening <span class="smcapall">A</span> allows the oil to descend into the cylinder and lubricate the surface.</p>

<p>Now for the method. Chuck a piece of brass wire about a quarter of an inch in
diameter in the lathe, and turn up to external shape; then turn out cup <span class="smcapall">C</span> and drill
through from end to end with fine drill; then enlarge chamber <span class="smcapall">D</span> with small bent
graver, and take out of lathe and drill through at right angles to previous hole at <span class="smcapall">A</span>
and <span class="smcapall">B</span> with larger drill; then put plugs of brass wire in and fit them with emery and
oil; rivet over one end, and the other turn up into a handle. Then turn them in
straight line with the oil-cup, and drill through with the small drill again. Tap the
end <span class="smcapall">E</span>, and screw into cylinder cover, when it is finished.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigX13">
<img src="images/illo141d.jpg" alt="launch engine" width="350" height="424" />
<p class="caption">FIG 13</p>
</div>

<p>To keep the boiler full of water as the fire empties it by driving it off in steam,
the usual thing is to use a force-pump worked by an eccentric on shaft; but, as the
friction is excessive, it takes a great deal of power away from a model. It is best,
therefore, to work it by a hand lever, and the pump may be screwed on to the side
of boat, the suction <span class="smcapall">A</span> (<a href="#FigX13">Fig.
13</a>) being led through the boat&#8217;s side and riveted over,
and the supply <span class="smcapall">B</span> brazed into lower part of boiler.
<span class="smcapall">C</span> is the lever, and <span class="smcapall">D</span> the plunger,
which must be quite true, and turned up in the lathe; likewise the valves
<span class="smcapall">E</span> and <span class="smcapall">F</span>
and the stuffing-box tapped and drilled. It is best to work it up from a casting, and
the outside smooth down with an old file. The projection <span class="smcapall">G</span> will then have to be
drilled and the lever pivoted through, having first cut a slot at <span class="smcapall">H</span> to allow the lever
to rise and fall.</p>

<p>I will now describe a method of making an injector, or machine for filling the
boiler with water by the power of the steam alone, and not in connection with
the engine.</p>

<p>The injector was an accidental discovery by a Mr. Gifford, and has now become
a universal favourite on board both large and small craft, as it works splendidly
without affecting the engine. So you can run the boiler up with water whilst the
engine is at rest in harbour or otherwise. And another great advantage over pumps
is that the steam, being mixed with the water, raises it in temperature to nearly
boiling-point, and so is a great saving in fuel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigX14">
<img src="images/illo141e.jpg" alt="launch engine" width="200" height="479" />
<p class="caption">FIG 14</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#FigX14">Fig. 14</a> is a section of the instrument as fit for model work, and if you will follow
these instructions carefully it will act well.</p>

<p>It consists of three parts&mdash;the cone <span class="smcapall">A</span>, the cone
<span class="smcapall">B</span>, and the casing <span class="smcapall">C</span>. The steam
is admitted at <span class="smcapall">D</span>, and the water at
<span class="smcapall">E</span>, the waste water overflows at <span class="smcapall">F</span>, and the hot
steam and water is projected with great force into the boiler through the pipe <span class="smcapall">H</span>,
which should be led to the bottom of boiler well below low-water mark, and it is
quite imperative that the steam-pipe should come from top of boiler as so to get
plenty of dry steam, and must not be tapped on to any other pipe.</p>

<p>The injector can be fastened to side of boat by brass band and screws, and the
water-supply pipe brought through the side and riveted, as in the case with the
pump. The injector will lift water several inches, but it always works better if the
water can flow into it freely.</p>

<p>Now we will set to work at it. Take a piece of brass rod and chuck it in the
lathe and turn two cones the shape of <span class="smcapall">A</span> and
<span class="smcapall">B</span> (<a href="#FigX15">Fig. 15</a>). Take them off the
lathe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and drill <span class="smcapall">A</span> through as far as practicable, and finish with a small rhymer, having first
made a small hole right through not larger than a knitting-needle; then tap the port <span class="smcapall">C</span>
with an internal screw to take the steam-pipe, and turn a screw on the outside at <span class="smcapall">D</span>.</p>

<p>Now, with the rhymer bore out the conical hollow at <span class="smcapall">E</span> in
<span class="smcapall">B</span>, and tap it outside
at <span class="smcapall">F</span> and inside at <span class="smcapall">G</span>,
in the same manner as the former cone; then drill a small
hole right through from end to end, and a smaller one at right angles to the other
right through at <span class="smcapall">H</span>. This communicates with the overflow, and takes off the water
not carried into the boiler.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigX15">
<img src="images/illo143a.png" alt="launch engine" width="500" height="120" />
<p class="caption">FIG 15</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigX16">
<img src="images/illo143b.jpg" alt="launch engine" width="350" height="76" />
<p class="caption">FIG 16</p>
</div>

<p>Next take a piece of brass tubing five-eighths of an inch in diameter, and turn a
screw at each end inside (<a href="#FigX16">Fig. 16</a>). The screws
turned on the outside of the cones must be the
correct size to fit these; then drill a hole at <span class="smcapall">A</span>,
and screw in a small tube for water-supply with
tap; then drill another at <span class="smcapall">B</span> for the waste water
to escape by. Finally, screw in the cone
<span class="smcapall">A</span> (<a href="#FigX15">Fig. 15</a>) and attach it to the boiler by a pipe,
and the nearer the boiler the better, as if the
steam condenses before reaching the injector it
will stop working. The steam-pipe must of course
have a tap to cut off steam when not required.</p>

<p>We must now screw in the lower cone <span class="smcapall">B</span>
(<a href="#FigX15">Fig. 15</a>) until there is an annular space between
the two cones not exceeding a sixteenth of an
inch. Then screw in the small pipe at <span class="smcapall">C</span> (<a href="#FigX15">Fig. 15</a>),
and attach the other end into the boiler below
the water-line, where it must have a stop-valve to prevent the water returning.</p>

<p>To start the injector, turn on the water-tap until it runs out of the overflow
freely. Then turn on the steam full power, and the overflow will cease, or nearly so.
Should it still drip at the overflow, reduce the water supply by the tap accordingly.</p>

<p>It requires carefulness and patience to make an injector, but when done, and
working properly, there are few boys with a mechanical turn of mind who would
not think themselves well repaid in watching and controlling its mimic action. They
would then have an engine fit to show to their most critical friends, and one they
might well be proud of; and I shall be content if I have helped in any way to
contribute to their happiness.</p>

MODEL LOCOMOTIVE, AND
HOW TO BUILD IT.<br />
<span class="smcap">By H. F. Hobden.</span></p>

</div><!--hh-->

<p class="chapxibot">Those who class model engines as mere toys, and fit only
to amuse the very youngest members of the human family,
entirely forget the important place they hold in the estimation
of inventors and those interested in mechanism as a
means by which they can practically carry out their ideas,
because models not only have the advantage of cheapness
in construction as compared with the full-sized machine, but
also the still greater advantage of being, from the small size and light weights of their
parts, capable of construction by the inventor himself without having to employ
strangers.</p>

<p>I suppose there is no taste more universal amongst boys, old as well as young,
than that for mechanism and engineering. What boy does not feel interested in the
models displayed in the various shop windows in our large towns, and what lad with
any mechanical bent but has a longing to make one for himself and feels an intense
pleasure in being able to do so? And it is with the intention of helping those who
would like to build one, but have not the necessary knowledge, that I purpose to
explain, as simply as possible, the best method of building model locomotives.</p>

<p>In previous pages of this volume, practical instructions by skilled writers have
been given on model stationary engines of a simple make, and also on engines
for steamboats, but of all models the locomotive has the greatest charm for most
boys, and not unjustly so, as when well finished and carefully painted it has a
very handsome appearance, and moreover has the additional charm of its locomotive
power.</p>

<p>Those of my readers who have practically carried out the instructions in the
previous chapters just referred to, have become, I have no doubt, by this time quite
<i>au fait</i> in handling their tools and feel at home in their workshop; but for the
benefit of those boys who have had no practical experience, let me give a word or
two of advice before we begin our locomotive.</p>

<p>First then, with all engineering work, either large or small, great care must
be taken to get the measurements perfectly correct in spacing out the various parts
to be joined together, and do not think, because it is only a model you are
making,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
that any off-hand way will do, because you will find before the engine is half finished
that great accuracy is necessary if you wish your model to be a working one.</p>

<p>A slight mistake in the measurements of a large engine will cause so much
friction as to take half its power to overcome, and the same thing occurring in
a model would stop it entirely.</p>

<p>Then with respect to any part you may require to solder, be careful always to
make the brass or other metal you wish to unite quite hot. You will then get a good
firm joint.</p>

<p>Do not just touch the metal with the soldering iron and then take it away. You
might certainly stick the parts together slightly in that way, but they would be sure
to come apart the first time they received a blow or any pressure was put on them.</p>

<p>Soldering on the best work should be used very seldom, and all the fastenings
should be either done by riveting, screwing, or brazing; and I need hardly remark
that no part of a boiler should be soldered which comes in direct contact with the
flame of the lamp or furnace.</p>

<p>Brazing, with the exception of very small articles, is beyond the ordinary powers
of an amateur.</p>

<p>Even to braze the seams of a model boiler requires a forge fire or
very powerful gas-blast, which is too expensive for most boys to get; but
small things, such as a broken slide, valve rod, etc., can be easily brazed
by using a gas blow-pipe, and as it will cost you very little to make and
will prove a useful tool for sweating in solder as well as brazing, I
will briefly explain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI01">
<img src="images/illo145.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="125" height="321" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#FigXII01">Fig. 1</a> is a section of the blow-pipe complete.</p>

<p>To make it, first get a small piece of brass tube (<span class="smcapall">A</span>) of about half
an inch diameter and five inches long; drill a hole at two inches from
one end, and insert a piece of gas tube (<span class="smcapall">B</span>) and solder it in place.</p>

<p>Next take a piece of glass tubing a quarter of an inch diameter and
about seven inches long, hold one end in a gas flame, and when red-hot
draw it out to a fine point, then file round and break off the tip, leaving a
small hole.</p>

<p>Next squeeze a sound cork into the tube <span class="smcapall">A</span>
as at <span class="smcapall">C</span>, and drill a quarter of an inch
hole through its centre and insert the glass tube <span class="smcapall">D</span>, and the blow-pipe is finished.
To use it you connect the pipe <span class="smcapall">B</span> with a gas bracket by a rubber tube, and the glass
tube <span class="smcapall">D</span> must be fastened to a pair of bellows by means of another piece of rubber
tubing; the bellows should have an air-bag attached, to enable you to keep a constant
pressure up and prevent having a jerky flame.</p>

<p>When requiring to braze any article, bind the parts together with some very fine
brass wire and cover it up with a little powdered borax and water, then lay the
article on a piece of charcoal, and if it is necessary to preserve the temper of
the steel you are about brazing, cut a potato in half and push each end of the steel
rod into the halves, which will prevent the temperature of the rod getting too high.</p>

<p>When you have it all nicely fixed, turn on the gas and light your blow-pipe,
immediately work the bellows with your foot, and by either pushing in the glass
tube <span class="smcapall">D</span>, or drawing it slightly out, you can regulate the shape of the flame as
required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Then bring the flame to bear on the joint, well supplied with the borax, and soon
you will find the brass wire melt and run into the joint like water. It must then be
neatly filed up, and the join will be scarcely visible.</p>

<p>Having made this useful tool, I will mention a few others you should get before
commencing work; they will not cost much.</p>

<p>A centre punch or pointed steel spike for marking metal for drilling, etc., and a
small riveting hammer, three or four files of different degrees of fineness, a screw
plate and taps, and also a small hand-drill with a set of drills to fit, will be most
useful; and of course very little can be done without a good firm vice.</p>

<p>If you have a lathe, so much the better; it will enable you to save lots of odd
coppers for turning various parts. Curves for bending metal on you can easily
make from pieces of bar iron, holding them in the vice when working on them.</p>

<p>When you have your tools ready, the materials are required you intend working
on, which will consist of several sheets of brass and copper, the castings and various-sized
screws and bolts; and having got these all together, we can set to work on
our locomotive.</p>

<p>I think it would be better to first give you directions for making a simple one of
about fifteen inches, and then to proceed to a more perfect model after.</p>

<p>In a <a href="#Page_117">previous article</a> you will find a description of the action of the steam
in the cylinder, and although that is in a marine engine, the action is precisely
the same in the cylinders of a locomotive, and you should therefore read the
description carefully and thoroughly understand it; there is also given a method
of turning the cylinders, and hence I shall not describe the process again, but
consider that you already know sufficient about it, should you wish to make your
cylinders in preference to buying them ready finished.</p>

<p>At the commencement of this chapter is a <a href="#Page_144">drawing</a> of the model we are about to
build in its finished condition, and <a href="#FigXI02">Fig. 2</a> is a side view of the same, of which <span class="smcapall">A</span> is

a set thumb-screw to fasten a tender on by, <span class="smcapall">O</span> is the lamp, and
<span class="smcapall">P</span> is a small tap, used to ascertain the quantity of water in the boiler. The handrails
<span class="smcapall">R</span> and <span class="smcapall">S</span> complete
it; and I think this is sufficiently clear for you to perfectly understand
the general working arrangements of the model.</p>

<p>Locomotives, whether real or only model ones, can all be divided into three
principal parts, viz., the carriage or framework, the engine or cylinders and parts
connected with them, and the boiler, and we will now proceed to make each part
in turn, beginning with the framework.</p>

<p>First take a sheet of brass for the bed-plate, about one-sixteenth of an inch thick,
and cut it to an oblong shape, four inches wide by fourteen inches long, as in <a href="#FigXI03">Fig. 3</a>,
and be very careful that the corners are right angles. This is to be hammered out
quite flat and filed up smooth, and finished with emery cloth held round a flat piece
of wood; you must also cut a hole in it for the boiler to rest in as at <span class="smcapall">C</span>, beginning
half an inch from <span class="smcapall">B</span> and making the hole eleven inches long by one inch and a half
wide, taking care it is quite central on the line <span class="smcapall">AB</span>, or you would get your engine
lopsided, and you must take the same care in setting the chimney, steam dome, etc.,
as when not exactly central it gives a bad unsightly look to an otherwise well-finished
model.</p>

<p>The next step is to cut out the side frames (<a href="#FigXI04">Fig. 4</a>),
drilling holes at <span class="smcapall">A B C</span> for the
axles to work in; you can finish both sides in the same way, and, turning the bed-plate
upside down, fasten the frames on at a quarter of an inch from either side by
small angle pieces, as in <a href="#FigXI05">Fig. 5</a>, or by soldering, which is much quicker. Then
fasten by the same means a piece across each end about half an inch deep, and the
frame is ready for the wheels.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI06">
<img src="images/illo147b.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="75" height="316" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 6.</p>
</div>

<p>These can be had ready finished, but if you have the castings, they must
be chucked in the lathe and the tires turned up to the form shown in <a href="#FigXI06">Fig. 6</a>. The
small wheels should be about two and a half inches diameter and the driving wheels
four inches. The rim <span class="smcapall">B</span> should project a little over one-sixteenth of an inch, and
the rest of the edge should be bevelled off slightly as at <span class="smcapall">A</span>.</p>

<p>The spokes may then be filed up smooth, previously drilling out the centre hole
for axle before removing it from the lathe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI07">
<img src="images/illo147c.png" alt="model locomotive" width="150" height="167" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.</p>
</div>

<p>Great care must be taken to turn both the driving-wheels to exactly the same
diameter, or one wheel would travel farther in a revolution than the other, and as
they ought to be both fixed rigidly on to the crank shaft, the engine would never
travel in a straight line, but would always run in a circle. You will require some
steel wire for the axles, and can fasten them to the wheels by soldering or by
cutting a slot with a fine file in the centre of wheel, as at
<span class="smcapall">A</span>, <a href="#FigXI07">Fig. 7</a>; then filing a
small portion of the ends of the axle flat, drive in a brass wedge made from a piece
of wire, which will hold them together firmly.</p>

<p>The crank shaft or axle must be hammered up to shape, making it hot occasionally
in the gas flame whilst working it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI08">
<img src="images/illo147d.png" alt="model locomotive" width="100" height="294" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 8.</p>
</div>

<p>The cranks should be at right angles to each other, and the throw of the crank
is to be half the distance of the cylinder stroke. For instance, say the cylinders
are an inch and a half in stroke, the distance between <span class="smcapall">A B</span>
(<a href="#FigXI08">Fig. 8</a>) will be three-quarters
of an inch; you must then ease the size of crank at <span class="smcapall">A</span>, to prevent the piston
knocking the cylinder ends.</p>

<p>The cylinders require such extreme care in turning that it is by far the best
plan to buy them ready to put on your framework; and if you get a pair of
oscillating ones three-quarters of an inch bore and about an inch and a half stroke,
you will get sufficient power to drive your locomotive several miles an hour.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI09">
<img src="images/illo147e.png" alt="model locomotive" width="600" height="183" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 9.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#FigXI09">Fig. 9</a> shows you an underneath view of the framework and the position to
place the cylinders in, which should be supported by a couple of lugs (<span class="smcapall">A A</span>) screwed
to the bed-plate <span class="smcapall">B</span> which must have a piece cut out on either side to allow the
driving-wheels (<span class="smcapall">C</span>) to work in, as at
<span class="smcapall">D</span>, because, being larger than the others, they
project beyond the top of the bed-plate, as shown in <a href="#FigXI02">Fig. 2</a>. You can now screw
on by means of the hook <span class="smcapall">F</span> the buffer-beam, previously cut from a piece of mahogany,
five inches long, half an inch thick, and one inch deep, nicely squared and sand-papered.</p>

<p>Drill a hole at <span class="smcapall">G</span> and pass the shank of hook through the beam and piece of
brass in front of frame, and screw up tight with nut <span class="smcapall">H</span>.</p>

<p>The buffers can be properly turned up and fitted with springs, but that I will
explain when making our more perfect model, and content ourselves now with a
couple of brass flat-headed screws, such as are used in connections of electric
batteries, and which form capital imitation buffers, one having to simply screw
them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
into the beam about one inch from either end, leaving them projecting about half
an inch.</p>

<p>The framework is now sufficiently complete to be lacquered. First polish every
part intended to be bright, carefully removing all traces of file-marks and any
grease that may be on the work by a little acid; and after drying it place it on a
sheet of iron held over the gas&mdash;or fire, if clear&mdash;until it is moderately warm. You
can then apply the lacquer with a small brush, taking care not to go over any part
more than once. The lacquer can be had at most model shops, and is cheaper to
buy ready-made than to prepare yourself.</p>

<p>The spokes of the wheels should be painted; black-lined on green looks very
well, and the ordinary tube oil-paint, mixed with a little mastic varnish, is the best
to use.</p>

<p>The buffer-beam should be varnished, and the cylinders ought to have a coat of
paint, leaving the cylinder-covers and the flanges bright.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI10">
<img src="images/illo147f.png" alt="model locomotive" width="500" height="276" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 10.</p>
</div>

<p>The frame may now be put aside to dry, covered up from dust by a paper box,
whilst we proceed to make the boiler (<a href="#FigXI10">Fig. 10</a>).</p>

<p>This is a most important part of the locomotive, and is the cause of a great
many failures and unsatisfactory working, even amongst the professionally-built
models. I well remember how, when a lad at school, I fell deeply in love with a
beautiful highly-polished brass locomotive of about the size we are now building,
which was displayed in an optician&#8217;s window. Having made inquiries about the
price, and got it reduced from to &pound;5 to &pound;4, with a promise to keep it for me, I set to
work to save my pocket-money, and for some months rigidly abstained from all
kinds of tarts and toys; and when finally the last shilling was saved which completed
the amount, and I carried it&mdash;my first model&mdash;home in triumph, no boy was
ever happier. But, oh! the bitter disappointment when, after getting up the steam
and trying to start the engine, I found it would not work.</p>

<p>I was too young then to find out the reason, and the man who kept the shop,
not being a practical mechanic, could give me no help, and although, after we had
tried it together, he offered to take it back, I decided to keep it with a view to
remedy the defect, if possible; but it was a long time before I found out that the
fault lay in the boiler not being able to supply sufficient steam for the cylinders, in
consequence of not having enough heating surface acted on by the lamp.</p>

<p>Since that day I have made numerous models, and have always taken precautions
to avert such a difficulty, and although the method I am about to describe entails a
little extra work, you will feel well repaid for the trouble when you find what a
splendid head of steam can be kept up.</p>

<p>The boiler should be eleven inches long by three inches and a half in diameter,
and you can buy copper tubing of that size which is very suitable for the job, or
you can form it from a sheet of copper or brass bent to shape round a wooden
roller, and either riveted or soldered together. You must then turn two circles
of brass about an eighth of an inch thick for the ends, and polish the outside of
each nicely.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI11">
<img src="images/illo150a.png" alt="model locomotive" width="100" height="257" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 11.</p>
</div>

<p>Then push them into either end of the boiler about an eighth of an inch from
the edge, as in <span class="smcapall">A</span> (<a href="#FigXI11">Fig. 11</a>); they can now be soldered in place, and you will find
your gas blow-pipe very useful here. The projecting flange should be
hammered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
down all round, like <span class="smcapall">B</span> (<a href="#FigXI11">Fig. 11</a>), which can also be sweated afterwards with solder,
and finished off with a half-round file.</p>

<p>When filing solder or lead, only use an old worn file, as the soft metal soon fills
up and spoils a good one, and although it can be melted out by heat, it is not
advisable to do so.</p>

<p>You will now require to drill a hole at <span class="smcapall">A</span> (<a href="#FigXI10">Fig. 10</a>) for the chimney, which should
be three-quarters of an inch in diameter. Then cut a slot in the bottom of the
boiler six inches long
by an inch and a half
wide, commencing a
quarter of an inch from
the forward end of the
boiler.</p>

<div class="figc400">

<div class="figleft" id="FigXI12">

<img src="images/illo150d.png" alt="model locomotive" width="184" height="220" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 14.</p>
</div>

<p>Now take a sheet of
copper and cut a piece
about six inches and a
quarter long by six
inches broad, and bend
it over a wooden roller
to the shape shown at
<a href="#FigXI12">Fig. 12</a>, keeping it an
inch and a half apart
between <span class="smcapall">A B</span>. Cut also
two other pieces of
copper to the shape
of your bent sheet
(<a href="#FigXI12">Fig. 12</a>), and make
it long enough to reach
to the dotted line.
These form the two
ends, which may be
placed an eighth of an
inch from the edges,
as in <a href="#FigXI13">Fig. 13</a>, and
soldered in place, and
the projecting rims turned over and sweated with solder from the outside in the
same manner as you did to the boiler-ends in <a href="#FigXI11">Fig. 11</a>. Then drill a three-quarter-inch
hole at <span class="smcapall">B</span> (<a href="#FigXI13">Fig. 13</a>) for the bottom of chimney-tube to go into, and cut
a piece of three-quarter-inch brass tubing of sufficient length to pass out at top of
boiler about half an inch, as shown at <span class="smcapall">A</span> (<a href="#FigXI10">Fig. 10</a>). You can then hammer out a
rim or flange on the bottom end of chimney-tube, and push it up through the hole
in the copper box and solder it in place from the top, as at <span class="smcapall">A</span> (<a href="#FigXI14">Fig. 14</a>).</p>

<p>Now drill a couple of small holes at each end of the box <span class="smcapall">B C</span> (<a href="#FigXI14">Fig. 14</a>); these
should be rather more than an eighth of an inch in diameter, to allow an eighth of
an inch tube to pass through.</p>

<p>Get two twelve-inch lengths of hard-drawn steam-piping of an eighth of an
inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
in diameter, and with your screw-plate put a thread on each end of about half
an inch in length, then drill some holes in any odd piece of brass plate, and with
the screw-taps form eight nuts to fit the threads on the piping, and finish them up
to shape with a file.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI15">
<img src="images/illo150e.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="368" height="75" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 15.</p>
</div>

<p>Then take the piping and bend it very gently, to prevent it cracking, round a bar
of iron or handle of some tool held in the vice until it is of the form shown at
<a href="#FigXI15">Fig. 15</a>. Do each one the same, and then mix a little turps with some white lead
and smear each end where you have formed the screws, taking care not to get any
into the tubes, and they might have a plug of paper put in temporarily to prevent it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI16">
<img src="images/illo150f.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="450" height="229" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 16.</p>
</div>

<p>Now put a nut on at either end as far as the thread will allow it, and smearing
a little white lead round the holes drilled in ends of box <span class="smcapall">B C</span> (<a href="#FigXI14">Fig. 14</a>), push the
tubes in from the inside and screw up firmly with the remaining nuts in the
position shown at <a href="#FigXI16">Fig. 16</a>. The inside nuts can then be tightened up with a
spanner, and if you have carefully done this you will never be troubled with any
leakage, no matter what pressure you may get in the boiler.</p>

<p>These tubes are immensely strong, and from their small size the water in them
is raised quickly to a higher temperature than that contained in the rest of the
boiler, causing a continual circulation to take place and a constant supply of steam
to be formed.</p>

<p>The box can now be placed in the boiler through the slot cut in the bottom,
taking care that the top of box is not more than half way up the boiler, as in <span class="smcapall">B</span>
(<a href="#FigXI10">Fig. 10</a>). This will leave a portion projecting below the lower edge of boiler,
like <span class="smcapall">C</span>. This part protects the flame of the lamp from being blown away by the
draught caused by travelling along, which would cause you to lose steam. Solder
it firmly in position from the outside, to prevent the flame touching any soldered
portion. Also solder neatly round <span class="smcapall">A</span> (<a href="#FigXI10">Fig. 10</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI17">
<img src="images/illo150g.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="100" height="349" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 17.</p>
</div>

<p>The chimney can be made from another piece of three-quarter brass tube. Chuck
it in the lathe, and turn it up bright, and put a collar on it at
<span class="smcapall">A</span> (<a href="#FigXI17">Fig. 17</a>) to allow it
to push on to the piece of tube left projecting at <span class="smcapall">A</span> (<a href="#FigXI10">Fig. 10</a>).</p>

<p>The top of chimney, or bell-mouth, <span class="smcapall">B</span> (<a href="#FigXI17">Fig. 17</a>), will require turning in the lathe
also, and fitting on neatly.</p>

<p>The steam-chest <span class="smcapall">D</span> (<a href="#FigXI10">Fig. 10</a>) is a brass casting you can turn up also, and after
cutting a circular hole in top of boiler of about an inch in diameter it can be either
screwed or soldered on, previously putting the steam-pipe <span class="smcapall">E</span> in position by drilling
a hole at <span class="smcapall">F</span>, and after bending it as shown, pass it
through at <span class="smcapall">F</span> and solder in place.</p>

<p>The top of pipe <span class="smcapall">E</span> should be about a quarter of an inch from top of inside of
steam-chest.</p>

<p>Before soldering on the steam chest drill a couple of holes, as at <span class="smcapall">G H</span> (<a href="#FigXI10">Fig. 10</a>),
one for the small lug <span class="smcapall">G</span> to be screwed into, which holds one end of the lever of the
safety valve, and that at <span class="smcapall">H</span> should be drilled conical
with a rhymer, and the valve <span class="smcapall">H</span>
can be turned in the lathe, and afterwards ground to fit the hole with a little emery
and water, by means of a slot cut across the top and worked round with a screw-driver.</p>

<p>The spring-case of safety-valve is easily made from a piece of the one-eighth of
an inch brass tubing, and using some small, hard brass wire to form the spring of.
When finished it should be hooked to the eye screwed into boiler at <span class="smcapall">V</span>.</p>

<p>The manhole, or screwhead, <span class="smcapall">K</span>, is
used to refill the boiler by when it has steamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
low, and will require to be turned up to shape; and the bed <span class="smcapall">L</span> it screws into can be
firmly soldered on the boiler, having first drilled a hole slightly larger than the
diameter of the screw itself, which should be sufficiently large to allow an ordinary
tin funnel to be used to refill by, and the screw ought to be large enough to hold a
leather washer under the head to keep it steam-tight.</p>

<p>The whistle <span class="smcapall">M</span> will require a hole drilled for it to be screwed into, and that, as
also the steam-tap <span class="smcapall">N</span> and water-tap
<span class="smcapall">O</span>, can be bought cheap ready to put on, and is
more satisfactory than making them yourself. But should you wish to do so, the
method I have already described in Chapter X. of making an oil-cup applies equally
to these.</p>

<p>The tap <span class="smcapall">O</span> should be screwed in at a slightly
higher level than the top of box <span class="smcapall">B</span>,
and when working the engine, should steam issue from it when turned on instead
of water, you ought to immediately blow off steam by safety-valve <span class="smcapall">H</span>. Then unscrew
<span class="smcapall">K</span>, and refill the boiler with water.</p>

<p>By this time the framework will no doubt be quite dry, and you can then clean
and polish the boiler and attach it to the frame by a screw or solder at the forward
end, and the steam-pipe <span class="smcapall">N</span> can be screwed on to the projecting
piece of tube left at <span class="smcapall">F</span>, whilst you also screw a short
length of pipe into the steam-box of engine through a hole
in the bed-plate. Then bend it up to the steam-tap and
solder them carefully in position; this will hold the after
end of boiler firmly.</p>

<p>Go over every soldered joint to see if any small hole
is left, and re-solder where necessary, as a hole in the
boiler not larger than a pin&#8217;s point would prevent you
getting any adequate pressure of steam, as the water would
all blow out.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI18">
<img src="images/illo152a.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="300" height="141" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 18.</p>
</div>

<p>When so far complete, you can either lacquer or paint
the boiler as suits your fancy, and whilst it is drying
there will be time to make the lamp (<a href="#FigXI18">Fig. 18</a>).</p>

<p>It is simply an oblong box made of tin or any piece of thin metal you may have,
and should be one inch and a quarter wide by five inches long, and about three-quarters
of an inch deep. To make it, cut say a piece of tin four and a half inches
by five inches, and bend it to shape, then solder the two edges together and cut
two ends to fit. Push them in and solder in place.</p>

<p>Then cut three pieces of brass quarter-inch tubing into three quarter-inch lengths,
drill holes in top of lamp and insert them, allowing about a quarter of an inch to
project, as at <span class="smcapall">A</span> (<a href="#FigXI18">Fig.
18</a>); then solder them on four pieces of bent wire (<span class="smcapall">C C C C</span>), by
which to hang the lamp by means of two wire pins run through them and small holes
drilled in sides of projecting piece <span class="smcapall">C</span> (<a href="#FigXI10">Fig. 10</a>).</p>

<p>The screw-filler <span class="smcapall">B</span> (<a href="#FigXI18">Fig. 18</a>) will have to be soldered in also, and when complete
the tubes <span class="smcapall">A</span> may be filled with cotton wick, and the lamp about three parts full of
methylated spirit, which will give a clear smokeless flame.</p>

<p>You can now start your locomotive by filling the boiler about three parts full of
hot water, and then hooking the lamp underneath; you will soon get a good pressure
of steam up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>See that all the taps are turned off; and if there is no leakage from careless
workmanship, you will find, on turning the steam-tap on, the locomotive will run
beautifully, and will travel at great speed either on a smooth oil-cloth or wood floor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI19">
<img src="images/illo152b.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="350" height="190" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 19.</p>
</div>

<p>I will presently explain how to make a set of rails, on which she would run much
quicker still; but for this engine, if you make a small tender of the shape shown at
<a href="#FigXI19">Fig. 19</a>, and fasten it at any angle by the set-screw on the foot-plate of the engine
shown at <span class="smcapall">N</span> (<a href="#FigXI02">Fig. 2</a>), the model will run in any sized circle you may wish, without
lines, according to the angle at which you fix the tender to the engine.</p>

<p>Wooden coal trucks, etc., you can easily make to complete the train if you wish;
but of course each one is an extra load for the engine to draw, and will prevent it
going as quickly as when alone.</p>

<p>Tin is the best material to use for the tender, as no great strength is required;
indeed, it should be made as light as possible. The wheels and axles you must
finish in the same manner as those on the engine; and it could be made into a
tank, to hold an extra supply of spirit, by soldering a piece of tin round the inside,
and covering it in with another piece cut to shape, and fitted with a screw-nut to fill
by, as shown in <a href="#FigXI18">Fig. 18</a>.</p>

<p>If you have carefully followed these simple directions, and also practically
carried them out, you will be able, and no doubt anxious to try your constructive
powers on a more complete model, and I will therefore endeavour to help you to
do so.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A more Finished Model.</span></h4>

<p>Should you be able to draw, you will find it a great help if you carefully sketch
out on a sheet of cartridge paper the locomotive to the exact size you intend
building it.</p>

<p>You can then take all the measurements from it, which will prove to be a saving
in time and trouble. Of course the larger you make the engine, the more expensive
the castings and materials will be; but if you persevere in making the locomotive I
am about to describe, you will have a model of real value to you, and which would
probably cost fifty pounds to buy ready finished; and if you turn the wooden models
for the castings yourself, and use sheet-iron for the framework, etc., where possible,
the total expense will not be so very great.</p>

<p><a href="#FigXI20">Fig. 20</a> is a side view of the locomotive in its finished state, and we will begin to
work at it in the same manner as in the former model, viz., with the framework;
but as some of my readers may have a preference for some special type of engine
other than the one drawn, they can easily build it from the following directions, and
keeping the same proportion in size as in <a href="#FigXI20">Fig. 20</a>, which is drawn to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-inch scale.</p>

<p>The entire length should be about three feet two inches, and the bed-plate
thirty-five inches by nine inches wide. The driving-wheels are eight and a quarter
inches in diameter, and the leading wheels five and a quarter inches, and about six
and a half inch gauge, viz., the space between the lines on which the wheels run.</p>

<p>The cylinders should be one and three-quarter inch bore by two and a half inch
stroke, which will give sufficient power to drive the engine at a high rate of speed,
with 30 lb. to 50 lb. of steam. The boiler is twenty-eight inches long, including
smoke-box, by five inches diameter.</p>

<p>In <a href="#FigXI20">Fig. 20</a> I have lettered the various parts, and it will be well to look over
them carefully, as this engine differs materially from the previous model in its

<p>Now to commence making the framework. This should be made of one-eighth
of an inch sheet-iron, squared up perfectly true and flat, and cut out as shown in
<a href="#FigXI21">Fig. 21</a>, commencing four inches and a half from
<span class="smcapall">A</span>, and leaving six inches at <span class="smcapall">B</span>, and
cutting it six inches wide there by eight inches long, and continuing it four inches
wide for the rest of the distance. Be careful to keep it quite central on the line
<span class="smcapall">A B</span>, and leave two connecting strips one inch wide, as at <span class="smcapall">C C</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI22">
<img src="images/illo155b.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="400" height="73" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 22.</p>
</div>

<p>The side-frames come next. These must be much stronger, and quite different
from those used in our previous model, and should be cut from the same eighth of
an inch plate-iron to the shape shown in <a href="#FigXI22">Fig. 22</a>.</p>

<p>The centre of slot <span class="smcapall">B</span> is seventeen inches from
one end, the centre of <span class="smcapall">A</span> ten inches
from <span class="smcapall">B</span>, and centre of <span class="smcapall">C</span>
thirteen inches from <span class="smcapall">B</span>.</p>

<p>In marking out work always measure from a fixed centre, for if you add
one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
measurement to another any slight inaccuracy gets increased with each fresh
measurement, and you might finally get the different portions out of place.</p>

<p>The slots are each an inch and a quarter wide by two inches deep, leaving one
inch of iron at top as shown. The ornamental spaces can then be cut out, which
lightens it considerably without weakening it much.</p>

<p>The frames, after being smoothed up, can be fastened to the bed-plate in the
manner described before by angle-irons or knees riveted on. Two end-pieces must
also be prepared an inch deep, and the ends hammered square at right angles, and
then riveted to the bed-plate and side-frames, as shown by the rivets in <a href="#FigXI20">Fig. 20</a>.</p>

<p>Then drill three holes in them about an inch and a half from either end, and one
in centre by which to bolt on the buffer-beams by means of a couple of screws put
in from the back.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI23">
<img src="images/illo155c.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="250" height="90" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 23.</p>
</div>

<p>The buffer-beams should be mahogany, one inch wide, two inches deep, and ten
inches long, squared nicely and sand-papered. A hook can then be made (<a href="#FigXI23">Fig. 23</a>),
and, a hole being drilled in the centre of beam, you can pass the hook-stem through
and into central hole of framework, and screw up tightly with nut at back, which
will hold all firmly in place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The buffers for this model must be made properly with springs to take the
pressure, should you let it run into anything.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI24">
<img src="images/illo155d.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="450" height="187" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 24.</p>
</div>

<p>Turn out a wooden mould in the lathe and get four castings in brass made from
it. <a href="#FigXI24">Fig. 24</a> is an ordinary kind of buffer in general use, and, being in section, shows
you the working arrangement of the spring, <span class="smcapall">A</span> is cast with a square base-plate two
inches square, as in front view <span class="smcapall">B</span>, and is secured to buffer-beam by four flat-headed
screws. The piece <span class="smcapall">C</span> must be turned true, and just the size to slide in and out <span class="smcapall">A</span> easily.
Each part must be finished up in the lathe. <span class="smcapall">A</span> should be about an inch and a half long.</p>

<p>Drill a hole in beam to allow the head of pin to work in freely, and another hole
in base-plate of buffer the size of pin, whose head prevents the spring forcing <span class="smcapall">C</span>
entirely away from <span class="smcapall">A</span>.</p>

<p>The spring should be made of thick steel wire; the buffers can then be
screwed on as just mentioned. The wheel-guard, or line-clearer <span class="smcapall">P</span> (<a href="#FigXI20">Fig. 20</a>), can
next be cut out to shape and bolted on to frame, and should just clear the line by a
quarter of an inch.</p>

<p>We will now proceed with the axle-bearings and springs <span class="smcapall">U</span> (<a href="#FigXI20">Fig. 20</a>). The
wheels can be finished up in the same manner as previously described, so I need
not say anything further about them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI25">
<img src="images/illo155e.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="300" height="157" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 25.</p>
</div>

<p>Make a wooden model like <a href="#FigXI25">Fig. 25</a> and get six castings in brass made from it.
They then must be filed up square and smooth and fitted into the slots cut at
<span class="smcapall">A B C</span> (<a href="#FigXI22">Fig. 22</a>), and either screwed or riveted on by the side holes.</p>

<p>Before finally fixing them prepare six brass bearings (<span class="smcapall">B</span>, <a href="#FigXI25">Fig. 25</a>). They must
fit exactly, and slide easily in the inner surface of <span class="smcapall">A</span>, and a hole is to be drilled
centrally through each five-eighths of an inch in diameter. These take the axles,
which in this model are all straight, and three-quarters of an inch in diameter,
shouldered off to five-eighths for the bearings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI26">
<img src="images/illo155f.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="450" height="218" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 26.</p>
</div>

<p>The springs next require attention. Four pieces of either sheet iron or brass are
wanted in each support an inch and a half long by a quarter wide. A hole is to be
drilled at either end, as shown at <span class="smcapall">C</span> in
<a href="#FigXI26">Fig. 26</a>. <span class="smcapall">A</span> should be three-eighths of an inch
wide, drilled through and a pin put in, and all riveted together loosely.</p>

<p>The spring is best made from clock-spring, and cut to shape as at <span class="smcapall">D</span>. The top-piece
requires to be made hot with your blowpipe, and then the ends turned over
to hold the pin <span class="smcapall">B</span>. Each piece of spring must be slightly shorter than the upper,
and the ends nicely graduated off, and when ready held together by the brass band <span class="smcapall">F</span>,
which has a small hole drilled at <span class="smcapall">F</span> to hold the end of pin by which the pressure is
directed on to the axle-boxes, as shown in <a href="#FigXI20">Fig. 20</a>. A hole is also to be drilled
in bed-plate over centre of each axle-box to allow pin to pass through, and also a
smaller one an inch and a half on each side for the support <span class="smcapall">A</span> (<a href="#FigXI26">Fig. 26</a>) to screw
into. They can all be fitted into position.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI27">
<img src="images/illo155g.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="500" height="232" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 27.</p>
</div>

<p>The cylinders come next, and should be, as previously mentioned, an inch and
three-quarters bore by two and a half inch stroke. These should be of the fixed
slide-valve pattern, with double eccentrics fitted on middle axle-shaft, and reversing-lever
brought to quadrant on foot-plate, as I will show presently, and for the method
of making them I will again refer you to my article on the <a href="#Page_138">Model Launch Engine</a>, and
will simply give you in <a href="#FigXI27">Fig. 27</a> the modified form necessary to suit a locomotive, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>which
<span class="smcapall">A A</span> are the eccentrics, <span class="smcapall">B</span>
slide valve-rod, with guide <span class="smcapall">G</span> attached; <span class="smcapall">C C</span> the bed-plate,
<span class="smcapall">D</span> the balance-weight, and
<span class="smcapall">F</span> the rod leading to quadrant and lever on foot-plate.
The cranks are put on outside the wheels and fastened by keys, as in <a href="#FigXI20">Fig. 20</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI28">
<img src="images/illo157a.png" alt="model locomotive" width="250" height="89" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 28.</p>
</div>

<p>The connecting rods <span class="smcapall">T</span> should be cut to the form shown in <a href="#FigXI28">Fig. 28</a>, and the ends
squared out and a brass bush filled in with a hole drilled from top (<span class="smcapall">A</span>) to oil by,
and a set-screw <span class="smcapall">B</span> fitted to adjust the bearings perfectly.</p>

<p>Although these little things give extra work in fitting a model, they add considerably
to its finish and lessen the friction.</p>

<p>If you wish to fit a force-pump, it should be placed centrally between the cylinders,
and be worked by an eccentric on main shaft, but a pump on a model locomotive
is of very slight use unless it is arranged to work by hand also.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI29">
<img src="images/illo157b.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="500" height="349" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 29.</p>
</div>

<p>In <a href="#FigXI29">Fig. 29</a> I have given a practical method of arranging one to be worked either
way as desired. <span class="smcapall">A</span> is the pump,
<span class="smcapall">B</span> the eccentric on main-shaft to work it by steam
power; but when requiring to work the pump by hand, you have only to push up
hook connection at <span class="smcapall">C</span>, which disconnects it from eccentric, and then by working the
handle <span class="smcapall">D</span>, which is screwed into bottom of
plunger <span class="smcapall">C</span>, the water is forced into boiler.</p>

<p>This pump is a little more troublesome to make, as it requires an extra stuffing-box
at <span class="smcapall">F</span>, but it is very neat and useful, and the
handle lying quite out of the way, does not spoil
the appearance of the model.</p>

<p><span class="smcapall">G</span> is the exhaust water-pipe bent up to the back
pressure-valve on boiler, and <span class="smcapall">H</span> the supply-pipe
carried on to rear of engine.</p>

<p>You will find two small blow-off cocks on each
cylinder very handy to get rid of the condensed
steam when starting the engine with cold cylinders,
as without them the cylinders get choked, and you
stand a good chance of getting scalded by the hot
water being thrown up the chimney with considerable
force.</p>

<p>The blow-off cocks can be connected with a
tye-rod, and both worked from the foot-plate by a
single handle.</p>

<p>The parts being all finished to your satisfaction, you should paint the bed-plate
black, and side frames red, and when dry carefully line them black and white, and
also pick out the rivets with black.</p>

<p>Of course individual taste has a great deal to do with the finish of a model, so I
will leave it to you, merely suggesting you should get a fine lining tool to finish with,
and when all is complete put it aside to dry whilst we proceed to build the boiler.</p>

<p>This will require the greatest care, but with due attention you will be able to
turn it out well. Some sheet copper will be required one-eighth of an inch thick,
and although this is more expensive than iron, it does not rust, and is more suitable
for the work in hand.</p>

<div class="figc475">

</div><!--figc475-->

<p>First cut a piece nineteen inches long by sixteen wide, and bend it round,
forming a cylinder five inches in diameter; the lap must be closely riveted, and
then the two ends hammered out into a flange outwards, leaving the body of boiler
seventeen inches long, as in <a href="#FigXI30">Fig. 30</a>;
<span class="smcapall">B</span> is the shape of piece to be next
riveted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
at after end, then take another sheet nine inches wide, and hammer a half-inch
flange round it so as to fit over the dotted line in <span class="smcapall">A</span>.</p>

<p>Then rivet them firmly together, and also another piece in after end.</p>

<p>It will now have the appearance of <a href="#FigXI31">Fig. 31</a>, and should be four and a half inches
deep from <span class="smcapall">A</span> to <span class="smcapall">B</span>,
and forming a copper box six inches wide from <span class="smcapall">B</span> to <span class="smcapall">C</span>, and eight
inches from <span class="smcapall">C</span> to <span class="smcapall">D</span>.</p>

<p>Then rivet together another box to form the inner casing four and a half inches
wide by six and a half inches long and nine inches deep.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI32">
<img src="images/illo158c.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="300" height="277" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 32.</p>
</div>

<p>The bottom of this must be hammered outwards to the dimensions of <span class="smcapall">BC</span> <span class="smcapall">CD</span>,
as shown in section <a href="#FigXI32">Fig. 32</a> at <span class="smcapall">AA</span>. A hole is next to be cut out in the centre of
rear plate, and also the rear part of inner casing which comes opposite to it, and
one three-quarter inches by two and a half, forming an elliptical opening for the
furnace door.</p>

<p>A casting of that shape and three-quarters of an inch thick, which is the distance
between the inner and outer casing <span class="smcapall">BC</span>, must be procured and drilled with holes
every three-eighths of an inch, and firmly riveted in position, as shown in section
at <span class="smcapall">D</span>.</p>

<p>Two pins or lugs (<span class="smcapall">FF</span>) should project on either side
of the inner surface to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
support the fire-bars and ash-pan, and the bars should be made of cast-iron, and
small enough to be got out easily by tilting up one side, and the bars ought to run
lengthways of the engine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI33">
<img src="images/illo158d.png" alt="model locomotive" width="200" height="198" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 33.</p>
</div>

<p>You next require some hard-drawn brass tubing three-quarters of an inch
diameter, and must cut the pieces slightly over seventeen inches long, then drill ten
holes in the inner plate as at <span class="smcapall">E</span> (<a href="#FigXI32">Fig. 32</a>), and in the position and arrangement
shown in <a href="#FigXI33">Fig. 33</a>. These tubes should have a wire ring brazed on about a quarter
of an inch from either end, and then being placed in their respective holes in tube
plate, the projecting portion is to be beaded back with a flange, or you can fit them
in as described previously (<a href="#FigXI16">Fig. 16</a>) by each being double-screwed and nutted.
These tubes allow the smoke and flame to pass through from the furnace to the
smoke-box (<span class="smcapall">M</span> <a href="#FigXI20">Fig. 20</a>), and so away up the chimney, and by the large surface they
expose to the fire, help to raise steam very quickly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI34">
<img src="images/illo158e.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="550" height="193" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 34.</p>
</div>

<p>If you just add together the combined surfaces of these tubes, you will find there
is more than two square feet of surface exposed and acted on by the fire, which
enables the boiler, although small, to make steam rapidly. In some large engines
three hundred tubes are fitted. The steam supply-pipe and regulating lever-handle
should now be made and placed in position, and <a href="#FigXI34">Fig. 34</a> shows the shape to
make it.</p>

<p><span class="smcapall">A B</span> are the front and rear plates of
boiler, <span class="smcapall">C</span> is the supply pipe, bent with a screw
end downwards after passing plate <span class="smcapall">A</span>, and then upwards into steam-dome, where it
should be securely fastened by a cross-piece; <span class="smcapall">D</span> is the tap or valve, which can be
turned on or off from the foot plate by means of the long rod <span class="smcapall">F</span>, ending in lever-handle
<span class="smcapall">G</span>.</p>

<p>The rod must be fitted with a stuffing-box, the same as those used on the
cylinders, and packed with cotton to prevent loss of steam by leakage; and when
this is all firmly fixed, the forward end of the boiler can be furnished with tube-plate,
riveted on and the tubes flanged over.</p>

<p>You should now take the boiler to a practical brazier and have it properly hard-brazed
in every join and round each tube, and you might cut the hole for steam-dome
and have it brazed on at the same time. If this is properly done you never need
be in fear when the water runs low, as the boiler might get almost red-hot without
injuring it much. Of course it is not advisable, as it would blister and spoil the
appearance of the paint outside. This is a good opportunity to test the boiler before
fitting it up, and you should fill it with water through a hole drilled in top of dome, and
then fix on the test-pump, which you could borrow from any engineering-shop. If
too far away from town to do that, you must make use of the force-pump attached to
your model, and work it by hand, watching the pressure-gauge in the meanwhile. Test
it to 100 lb. per square inch, which will be sufficient, as 50 lb. will be a fair working
pressure. Should you have to test it with your own pump, the pressure-gauge will
have to be bought then, as that is an article you cannot make yourself. A small
gauge of Bourdon&#8217;s make, of an inch and a half diameter, will cost about twenty-five
shillings, and although it may seem a rather high price for such a small thing, it is
absolutely necessary to have it, as you could not tell what dangerous pressure you
had raised in the boiler without it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI35">
<img src="images/illo158f.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="300" height="390" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 35.</p>
</div>

<p>This being done, proceed to make the smoke-box, which should be three
inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
deep, and of the same shape and dimensions shown in <a href="#FigXI35">Fig. 35</a>. This and the
chimney can be made of iron, hammered up to shape and finished with a brass ring.
The smoke-box can be screwed to the forward flange on boiler. The door is drawn
open to show the amount of bulge it should be hammered to.</p>

<p>In the centre a hole should be drilled through which to pass the screw used to
close it, which is attached to the loose bar <span class="smcapall">A</span>.
The handle <span class="smcapall">B</span> is then screwed up tight.</p>

<p>The door is circular and must be large enough to overlap the opening about
half an inch, and have a couple of bright iron or brass eyes (<span class="smcapall">C</span>) riveted on to form
the hinge.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI36">
<img src="images/illo158g.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="350" height="199" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 36.</p>
</div>

<p>We can now make the back pressure-valve (<a href="#FigXI36">Fig. 36</a>). <span class="smcapall">A</span> is a front view, with
plate by which it is bolted on to boiler, as at <span class="smcapall">W</span> (<a href="#FigXI20">Fig. 20</a>).</p>

<p>It is very simple to make, and consists of the casting <span class="smcapall">A</span> with the top and bottom
covers, and the ball-valve <span class="smcapall">B</span>, which ought to be ground with a little emery-and-oil
to fit perfectly. It acts in this manner. The water
being forced up <span class="smcapall">C</span> from the pump, raises <span class="smcapall">B</span> and
passes into the boiler. On the up-stroke of pump
the pressure is removed from under <span class="smcapall">B</span>, and pressure
of steam in boiler causes it to fall back and close
opening entirely, preventing any water passing away
from boiler. A small flange can be put on each
outer side of boiler near furnace to support it on
bed-plate level with smoke-box.</p>

<p>The boiler should now have a coating of flannel,
cut to shape and wrapped round the body part,
and a casing of sheet tin put over it and secured
by brass bands, and small nuts underneath, as shown
in <a href="#FigXI20">Fig. 20</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI37">
<img src="images/illo158h.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="300" height="324" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 37.</p>
</div>

<p>The steam supply-pipe can now be connected
with the cylinders, and it should be made forked, as
in <a href="#FigXI37">Fig. 37</a>. <span class="smcapall">A</span> leads from steam-pipe, and branches
off to each cylinder, where it must be screwed up
with white lead.</p>

<p>The exhaust-pipes (<span class="smcapall">B B</span>) should be of larger
tubing, and bent round up the sides of smoke-box,
so as to be out of the way when you require to clean the tubes. A small brass
pipe (<span class="smcapall">C</span>) must also be passed through chimney, and bent upwards and fitted with
tap, which should take steam from top of boiler, and be used as shown at
<span class="smcapall">D</span> and <span class="smcapall">F</span>
(<a href="#FigXI20">Fig. 20</a>). This helps to raise steam very quickly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXI38">
<img src="images/illo160.jpg" alt="model locomotive" width="300" height="425" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 38.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#FigXI38">Fig. 38</a> is a rear view of the foot-plate, and shows the necessary fittings you
must either make or buy to complete the model. The cocks you can manage
easily, but the water-gauge is beyond most amateurs&#8217; skill to turn out satisfactorily.
<span class="smcapall">A</span> is the furnace-door, <span class="smcapall">B</span> two
gauge-taps, <span class="smcapall">C</span> starting lever-handle, <span class="smcapall">D</span> spring-balance
safety-valve, <span class="smcapall">F</span> wind-guard (with two look-out hobs),
<span class="smcapall">G</span> steam-whistle handle,
<span class="smcapall">H</span> pressure-gauge, <span class="smcapall">K</span> steam-blast
handle, <span class="smcapall">M</span> glass water-gauge, <span class="smcapall">N</span> the quadrant and-lever
for reversing the engine, <span class="smcapall">O</span> the rear buffer beam (with
buffers), <span class="smcapall">P</span> the wheels
showing axle, <span class="smcapall">R R</span> the springs for same, and
<span class="smcapall">V</span> is the safety-guard rail on either side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>When these fittings are made, holes must be drilled in rear-plate for each, and
then firmly screwed in place with white-lead: and the glass tube in water-gauge
and the stuffing-box in gland of starting-lever should be packed with tallow and
cotton wick.</p>

<p>The entire engine can now have another coat of paint.</p>

<p>The smoke-box chimney and rear-plate should be black, and the body any
colour, according to fancy, leaving the brass bands bright.</p>

<p>When lined and quite dry it should have a coat of the best hard, clear varnish,
and again be allowed to dry thoroughly before using it, which by this time, I have
no doubt, you are anxious to do. Whilst it is drying you will have time to make
the lines for it. And you should get some square bar-iron, cut it into six-foot lengths,
if you wish the lines to be portable, and drill a hole in each end half an inch
deep. They then can be joined end to end by a wire, pin, or plug.</p>

<p>The lines must be kept at a proper distance apart by being secured to pieces of
wood placed transversely underneath by screws passing through holes drilled in the
rails at about every six inches. You can then lay them down end to end and
form a long line. If you want a circular line, each section must be bent to a portion
of a circle; one of about thirty feet diameter is suitable for this model.</p>

<p>When finished, place the locomotive on them and get up steam. Fill the boiler
with water by means of a funnel until you see it rise up three parts of the way in the
glass water-gauge. Then see that all taps are turned off and light the fire. Charcoal
forms the best fuel to use, as it gives a clear, hot fire, without smoke.</p>

<p>Try occasionally if you have any steam by lifting safety-valve, and when there
is any turn on the blast-tap, which will soon draw up the fire, and you will presently
see the pressure rise, and be indicated in the pressure-gauge.</p>

<p>When showing 30 lbs. of steam you might start her, turning on the cocks on
cylinders until no more condensed steam issues from them. Then shut them off and
turn on steam full power, and watch your model travel, gradually increasing its
speed; and I hope you will have many pleasant hours&#8217; enjoyment in running your
locomotive and showing its action to your friends, which will well repay you for
the time spent in building it.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">General Remarks on Games.</span></h5>

<p>The openings and endings of games,
which we have already explained, will
assist a beginner in understanding the
following observations.</p>

<p>Begin by moving the centre P&#8217;s (in the
e and d, and also in the c and f files), then
move the N&#8217;s to the fourth, third, or fifth
squares, and the O&#8217;s to the third or second
squares in the central files. Do not play
the L too soon. Place the men so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
they protect one another, that they guard
the K, and that they can easily attack the
opponent&#8217;s men, especially the K. Always
look out that your K is safe against checks,
or, at any rate, against any that would be
hurtful. Especially watch the vulnerable
points f1 and f7. Do not play your K out
early in the game, but try to move it together
with one of the M&#8217;s, especially on
the K&#8217;s side, in order that your officers
may have freedom of action, and then
you will in most cases do well to let the
g and h P&#8217;s remain in their places. When,
however, most of the officers (especially
the L and the two N&#8217;s) have been exchanged,
then you must generally bring
your K forward to support your P&#8217;s, etc.
Sometimes you can be patient with the
KM movement, namely, wait for a favourable
opportunity to perform it on the right
or left. Move the long way when your
opponent has taken the short one, and you
are able to attack him with your officers
and pawns. In rare cases you move your
K freely into the second row, mostly to f2
(or, if black, to f7), and this especially for
the purpose of uniting your two M&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Do not give check unless you see the
necessity for it. Give an early check if
thereby you can force the K to move and
thus prevent the KM movement. Be
mindful of discovered checks, in which,
besides the L and the M, the N is often
active.</p>

<p>When you see a good move try to discover
a still better one.</p>

<p>Generally keep the L so that it may not
be pinned by an M or an N, or be attacked
when an O checks.</p>

<p>In covering a check from an N or an
M it is in most cases best to interpose
a piece of the same kind in order to
prevent the piece being pinned for a long
time: but when the L checks, then you
should interpose your L only, when you
cannot well attack it by interposing an
inferior piece, or when you cannot protect
yourself with an O.</p>

<p>Try to attack two or three men at once
in order to capture one; by doing so endeavour
especially to make an attack
upon the two principal pieces, the K and
the L. The fittest pieces for this are the
L and the O, and sometimes the M.</p>

<p>Let your P&#8217;s protect one another, use
them for attacking the officers, try to get
them into open files, and avoid doubling
them. Push them forward on the side on
which your opponent has placed his K,
unless you have your K on the same side
and wish to keep it safe against checks.
Sometimes you can with safety place your
K before an adverse P.</p>

<p>Try to get an open file for your M&#8217;s,
and according to circumstances to move
one or both into your opponent&#8217;s second
row. Moving both into one file or row
is called doubling them. Try to clear
your P&#8217;s away in those files in which you
can attack the K with your M&#8217;s. When
you advance a P, consider if your opponent
will take it with his P or push his on.</p>

<p>Do not exchange pieces unless you obtain
an advantage by doing it, but when
you have an advantage, then do it as often
as possible. Sometimes you can with advantage
give an M for an N or an O.</p>

<p>If one of your men is attacked and
you cannot defend it, then try to make a
counter-attack, and always consider the
subsequent moves. Do not always take a
piece which is offered to you, but consider
the consequences.</p>

<p>If your L and another officer (M, N, or
O) be attacked, and you can save the
former but not the latter, then you will do
well, if you can, to give the L for two
minor officers, and then save your officer.</p>

<p>When you have a passed P, try to preserve
it and to protect it by P&#8217;s. A P in
the sixth or seventh row well supported is
generally worth an officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Towards the end of the game you must
use your K as an attacking officer. Keep
it from an adverse O, so that it cannot
easily be checked&mdash;that is, so that it stands
in the same diagonal with one square
intervening.</p>

<p>When each of you is left with an N and
two or three P&#8217;s, then the game, as a rule,
is easily drawn if the N&#8217;s stand on squares
of different colours. Your K should
generally be kept on a square of a different
colour from that on which the adverse N
stands. Let your P&#8217;s and N protect one
another if you are afraid of losing, but
keep the P&#8217;s on squares of a different
colour when you wish to prevent the adverse
K from coming near them.</p>

<p>Do not exchange an N for an O indiscriminately,
for an N can impede the
march of P&#8217;s more readily than an O.
And when the major officers are off, remember
that two N&#8217;s are stronger than an
N and an O, or two O&#8217;s. Prevent an isolation
and doubling of your P&#8217;s, for two
of them protect each other against the K
if the topmost is a passed one and no
officer left. You can often give your last
officer for one or two P&#8217;s, for these latter
may win, whilst a minor officer very rarely
can. Two P&#8217;s in the sixth row win, in
most cases, against an M.</p>

<p>Lastly, when you are about to give
mate, be mindful of stalemate.</p>

<h4>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A New Chess Game.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">&#8216;The Jubilee.&#8217;&mdash;By Herr Meyer.</span></h4>

<p>Each of the two players places alternately
one of his sixteen men, beginning
with the K, upon any square of his first
three rows. The two N&#8217;s may, if preferred,
be placed on the same colour. A check
within the first sixteen moves must immediately
be covered, and should it not be
possible to cover, then the player checked
has lost the game. When all the men are
placed, then the moving and taking begin,
the player whose turn it is to play having
the move. The K M move, that is, castling,
is not permitted. The pawns move,
and take in passing. A white P in the
first row, or a black P in the eighth row,
can start by moving one, two, or three
squares, or such a P may first move one
square and afterwards one or two squares,
but in his adversary&#8217;s territory only one
square at a time. When moving two or
three squares it can be taken in passing.
A black P on g 8 moving to g 5 can be
taken by white P&#8217;s standing on f5, f6, h5,
or h6. When a P reaches the last square,
then the player promotes it and chooses
any one of the seven officers which is not
on the board, but when all the officers are
on, then it remains a P for ever.</p>

<p>The letters from K to P are used for
the six kinds of pieces, thus<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The first game of this kind was played
in June, 1887, between H. F. L. Meyer
(White) and J. Swyer (Black). It is a
so-called diagonal game, because the K&#8217;s
are placed diagonally opposite one another
(on h1 and a8); it would have been a
straight game if the black K had been
placed on h8. Both players surrounded
their K&#8217;s with the P&#8217;s, and thus made sure
to be safe against checks for a long time.
The moves are the following<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>These two games show a remarkable
variety in the arrangement of the pieces,
and some beautiful new problems can be
constructed in accordance with the placements
and movements of the Pawns.
Indeed, some ancient problems gave the
impulse for the invention of this kind of
game in June, 1874, when the first game
of a similar arrangement was played
between H. F. L. Meyer and H. J. C.
Andrews. In 1874, however, the sixteen
men were placed on the board all at
once.</p>

<h4 id="Ref19">IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Game of Double Chess.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">By the late Captain Crawley and
Herbert Mooney.</span></h4>

<p>It seems an odd thing that in this
prolific age of literature the most fascinating
of all nineteenth-century games should
lack a recognized authority as to its play.
It is probably for this reason that Double
Chess has so long a time languished in
comparative obscurity, winning its way by
slow degrees only into club and family
circle.</p>

<p>No two strangers could be found to
agree as to the rules which should govern
its play, and the most imperative rule of
all, namely, that of <i>absolute silence</i>, has
been broken again and again with a royal
disregard of all fine or penalty.</p>

<p>Time after time has it been our lot to
sit over a foolish game where one&#8217;s partner
would insist either in giving way to vocal
bursts of impatience, or authoritatively
insist upon a move which happened to
chime in with his or her ideas. It must
be confessed that the fair sex are most to
blame in this matter. Though we are
reluctant to upbraid them, we have no
hesitation in saying that the infringement
of this golden rule of silence is one of the
fruitful sources of the hitherto unpopularity
of the game.</p>

<p>How often have the writers waited in
mute agony lest an exclamation of triumph
or despair from their partners should reveal
the imminent development of a well-planned
scheme, and how they have
plodded on, more from courtesy than any
real interest, after such an event has taken
place. We must insist that a heavy penalty
for a breach of this golden rule should be
rigidly enforced.</p>

<p>Let not the astute Single-chess player
delude himself with the notion that he can
march triumphantly to victory in this new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
game. Save that the pieces move in the
same manner (with one exception) as in
Single Chess, there is no similarity between
them, and we must say that the relative
interest of the two games is in favour of
the younger born. At any rate, the writers
think so. Beginners grow weary of Double
Chess because they find it occupies an
unreasonable length of time. This is
caused by the fact that they maintain a
desultory kind of warfare, each one selecting
an adversary and fighting him on his
own account.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXII15">
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Double Chess Board.</span></p>
<img src="images/illo174.png" alt="chess" width="400" height="401" />
<p class="caption">One hundred and sixty squares.</p>
</div>

<p>If the Double-chess player will remember
that it is absolutely essential to watch
his partner and second his moves, this
state of things will speedily disappear.
Those who wilfully neglect this may as
well content themselves with Single Chess.
No matter what their powers of calculation,
they will never make decent Double-chess
players.</p>

<p>Another imperative rule is always to
make your attack to the right and defend
on the left, taking care to guard your king
against check by a double guard. These
two rules will be referred to again at their
proper time; but we cannot too strongly
insist upon them, though, properly speaking,
they have no place in the introductory
remarks.</p>

<p>We have seen a very sensible and
modest little <i>brochure</i>, by Captain George
Hope Verney, which, unfortunately, is
printed for private circulation only. We
willingly bear testimony to its merits.</p>

<p>We must endeavour to combat the
popular error that Double Chess is too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
complicated for ordinary players. Any
one acquainted with the moves and rules
of ordinary chess can soon become a proficient,
and as for the notion that it requires
a great Single-chess player to make a good
Double-chess-player, we must call attention,
by way of analogy, to the fact that
gamekeepers generally make wretched
rifle-shots.</p>

<p>Exception must be taken to the name,
&#8216;Four-handed Chess,&#8217; given by some
players to this game. Why not Four-brained
Chess, or Four-person Chess, on
the same principle? Must we call Single
Chess Two-handed Chess? Double Chess
let it be called, since it has exactly double
the number of pieces engaged.</p>

<p>The <a href="#FigXII15">diagram</a> which we give will afford
an accurate idea of the board used in the
game of Double Chess.</p>

<p>It should consist of one hundred and
sixty squares, twenty-four extra squares on
each side of the central squares.</p>

<p>It is advisable to have the board to fold
in two, the blanks on each corner being
convenient for the reception of taken
pieces, enabling players to see at a glance
the amount of their own or their opponents&#8217;
losses.</p>

<p>Having placed the pieces on the board
as shown in the <a href="#FigXII15">diagram</a>, taking care that
the queens are on the same colour, the
adversaries proceed to try for first move, an
unquestionable advantage for eight moves.</p>

<p>This is done in the following manner:
Red takes one of Black&#8217;s and one of his
own pieces, and Black guesses, as in Single
Chess. White and Green do the same.
The conquerors then repeat, as in Single
Chess. The victor has first move, and
begins the attack, which should be directed
towards his right-hand adversary.</p>

<p>His partner is now bound to remember
that to him he must look for guidance,
guessing at his plan of attack, and aiding
him to the best of his ability.</p>

<p>Should the first mover decline to attack
he will move on the left, say his king&#8217;s
bishop&#8217;s knight to king&#8217;s bishop third for
defence.</p>

<p>This will be sufficient warrant for his
partner to make the attack and take the
lead, as it is obvious that first mover
wishes to follow instead of leading. In
such an event, after the first round number
one must look to number three for guidance.</p>

<p>The change is, at the best, a confession
of weakness, and we cannot recommend
its adoption, as in this game dash is most
essential to success.</p>

<p>Each player makes a move in turn from
right to left, and any player moving out of
his turn (<a href="#Rule11">Rule 11</a>) may be compelled to
move the piece on which he has placed
his hand, while his adversaries may also
move out of their turn. The justice of
this is obvious when one reflects that the
mere indication of a piece may give a clue
to the mover&#8217;s plan of attack or defence.</p>

<p>No consultation or suggestion of any
kind is allowed as the game proceeds
(<a href="#Rule01">Rules 1</a> and <a href="#Rule11">11</a>). Those who cannot
restrain shuffling their feet, wriggling in
their chairs, or grimacing over a certain
move, had better be avoided as partners.
Such a proceeding is more than undignified.</p>

<p>The pawns move only one square at a
time, taking obliquely, as in Single Chess.
When friendly pawns meet they leap over
each other, and continue their progress
until they reach partner&#8217;s king-row, when
they return.</p>

<p>No object is gained in causing your
pawn to reach your partner&#8217;s king-row,
except that coming back it takes in reverse
way.</p>

<p>It is therefore advisable when they meet
to permit them to remain together for
mutual protection, as in such position
they command four squares-forward and
backward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Should pawns by repeated captures
reach the adversary&#8217;s square, they become
any pieces their player chooses to name,
and such pieces cannot be taken except
by a piece equivalent in rank, or by a
king or queen (<a href="#Rule08">Rule 8</a>).</p>

<p>As, however, it is next to impossible for
a pawn to reach adversary&#8217;s square, seeing
that it can only do so by repeatedly capturing
antagonists, this advantage goes for
very little.</p>

<p>A pawn on the return march should be
marked by tying a piece of thread or a
ring round its neck. But it will be found
that but few, if any, pawns will have to be
so treated, and this most likely will occur
at the end of the game, when one or other
of the kings is hard pressed, and the pawn
is hastening to his assistance.</p>

<p>No player is allowed to expose either
his own or his partner&#8217;s king to check,
and, though he is not compelled to cover
his partner&#8217;s check, it is advisable in most
cases, when able to do so, as it will be
found that when the king is checked by
one adversary, the other will profit by it to
obtain a piece and a position.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that in this game everything
depends on mutual assistance and
self-sacrifice. In nine cases out of ten
the one who refuses to sacrifice in order to
save his partner from checkmate brings
speedy defeat on each.</p>

<p>Castling is not allowed; it is therefore
advisable to get out one&#8217;s knights as soon
as possible in order to give castles an
opportunity of moving out of the way of a
sudden combined attack.</p>

<p>Another advantage in getting out the
knights is that their greatest value is at
the beginning of the game.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the game, in consequence
of the combined action of the
pawns, and the distances to be traversed,
a knight&#8217;s value is greatly reduced.</p>

<p>We have found it advantageous to exchange
a knight for a bishop towards the
middle of the game.</p>

<p>The great object of the game is by
combined action to suddenly checkmate
one adversary. His pieces, though not
removed from the board, are then dead,
and cannot return to life until the checkmate
is removed.</p>

<p>They cannot be taken, but are practically
useless, except as offering the shelter
of inert matter to partner&#8217;s pieces.</p>

<p>One partner having been checkmated,
the antagonists concentrate their attack
upon the remaining one, with the enormous
advantage of having two moves to his
one!</p>

<p>Only, therefore, by making desperate
sacrifices to release his partner from
checkmate can the non-checkmated one
hope to save the game, except his adversaries
should stalemate him, when it is
drawn.</p>

<p>While one is checkmated the adversaries
may move in and out amongst his pieces
with impunity, and should adversaries&#8217;
kings do so, they are not exposed to
check, as the pieces are considered dead.</p>

<p>This is most important, as it enables
the adversaries, having once secured
checkmate, to render it permanent by
pieces of lesser value, withdrawing important
pieces to fight against remaining
partner, who, although combating single-handed,
may be numerically superior to
both.</p>

<p>It is lawful to open adversary&#8217;s checkmate
for the purpose of capturing any of
his pieces, who by that means are returned
to life. But it should be borne in mind
that if in doing this stalemate is given, the
game is drawn.</p>

<p>Though the adversary may at any time
open checkmate, he cannot in the same
move take a piece, but his partner may do
so, and he may close the checkmate again
at his discretion when it comes to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
turn. (See <a href="#Rule04">Rule 4</a>.) The game is only
won by both partners being checkmated.</p>

<p>A game is drawn when only one piece
is left on the board, or when only pawns
are left, as it is then impossible to secure
a double checkmate.</p>

<p>But should each partner have a piece,
or one of them two pieces, the game should
be fought out, as, with the assistance of
their kings, they may secure a double
checkmate.</p>

<p>The adversaries have the forlorn hope
of either taking one of their pieces&mdash;in
which case the game is drawn&mdash;or of
securing a stalemate.</p>

<p>This latter event, unlike the former case
given, in which one was checkmated
before the stalemate, will be a victory for
them, as one king is free to move.</p>

<p>It is as well for beginners, having
reached that stage of the game in which
only two pieces are left, to declare the
game drawn, with the honours of war
attached to those with the two pieces left,
as the game in that event will probably
last long enough to tire out the patience
of all engaged. Some ten years ago the
writers sat from six o&#8217;clock in the evening
until half-past four the following morning
over a game which had dwindled down to
the above-mentioned dimensions, and had
all but given up the task as hopeless ere
the desired result was obtained.</p>

<p>The pieces may range all over the
board, as in Single Chess, and are equally
at home in partners&#8217; squares as in their
own.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">RULES AND PENALTIES.</h5>

<p id="Rule01">1. Absolute silence must be maintained.
Should a player give vent to an exclamation
of vexation when his partner is about
to move a piece, the adversaries may
claim a pawn from any of his squares
which does not expose him to check.</p>

<p id="Rule02">2. A player checkmated may not indicate
to his partner how to obtain his
release.</p>

<p id="Rule03">3. No piece may be moved which will
discover check to player or his partner.</p>

<p id="Rule04">4. No player can release his antagonist
from checkmate by taking any of his
pieces.</p>

<p id="Rule05">5. Any player may call attention to
the fact that his partner&#8217;s queen is in
check.</p>

<p id="Rule06">6. But his own being in check, he may
not direct attention to that.</p>

<p id="Rule07">7. A king is not in check by any of his
partner&#8217;s pieces.</p>

<p id="Rule08">8. A pawn-piece can only be taken by
a piece of its own rank, or by king or
queen.</p>

<p id="Rule09">9. A player putting his hand on a piece
must play it. If he remove his hand, the
move must be considered as completed.</p>

<p id="Rule10">10. Adversaries&#8217; kings cannot stand next
each other on adjoining squares.</p>

<p id="Rule11">11. Should a player play out of his
turn, both his antagonists may play out of
theirs, and they are allowed to ask each
other which of them is desirous of moving
first.</p>

<p id="Rule12">12. No piece may be removed from the
board unless legally captured.</p>

<p id="Rule13">13. A pawn can only move one square
at a time, and not two squares first move,
as in Single Chess.</p>

<p id="Rule14">14. The game is only won when both
partners are checkmated. Should it be
relinquished before such an event, it is to
be considered drawn.</p>

<p id="Rule15">15. A player may not move his checkmated
partner&#8217;s pieces.</p>

<p id="Rule16">16. Antagonistic pawns may not leap
over one another.</p>

<p id="Rule17">17. A player may not take a piece
while his king is in check, except to release
himself from check.</p>

<p id="Rule18">18. A king may not move out of check
if by so doing he exposes his partner&#8217;s
king to check.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p id="Rule19">19. With kings and one piece only
remaining, or with pawns only, the game
is drawn.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">REMARKS.</h5>

<p>Never reproach your partner for having
made a blunder. It is useless blowing up
the groom after the horse is stolen; and
as it is essential above all things that a
cool head should be kept over this fascinating
game, if your partner is inclined to
be nervous, and you &#8216;nag&#8217; at him, you
may as well consider the game lost.</p>

<p>We remember an instance in America
when a really good player, who had been
wofully badgered by his partner for some
blunders, remained for an hour and a half
studying the board, lest he should make a
false move and once more encounter his
partner&#8217;s terrible sarcasm.</p>

<p>At the expiration of that period he
arose without making the move, and
vowed, as he could not see that which
his partner deemed so important, he would
never play another game of Double Chess.
As far as our party was concerned, he
kept his word, and thus a very enjoyable
evening&#8217;s amusement was broken up.</p>

<p>It is almost needless to add, that while
refraining from rousing your partner&#8217;s
temper, it is equally important that you
should control your own. It is very provoking
to have a trap suddenly sprung
upon you, thanks perhaps to your partner&#8217;s
want of perspicuity, and lose an important
piece just when you imagine you had a
brilliant game in hand.</p>

<p>But however provoking this may be,
getting angry will only make matters
worse, for we defy an angry man to see
two moves ahead. Keep cool, bow
gracefully to the opposing storm, and wait
with sweetness of temper for the turn of
the tide.</p>

<p>Calmness and breeding are nowhere
more requisite than at the Double-chess
table. One cannot bully a stupid player
into playing well, and the only thing to be
done is to play the game rigorously, and
give or take no more than the fixed rules
require.</p>

<p>By adhering to this, all unpleasantness
will be avoided, and this charming game
will grow more and more in popularity.
Should you unfortunately discover that
constitutionally you are incapable of controlling
your temper, abandon the game
for ever. You will reap the reward of
your self-denial in the knowledge that
you will never again mar the pleasure of
those whom Nature has cast in firmer
mould.</p>

<p>Theoretical knowledge is of value, but
practically it will be found more advantageous
to play a straightforward game
than to indulge in any scheme calculated
for a great number of moves ahead. It is
of the last importance that your partner
should know what you are about, and aid
you in your plans, else, despite your
brilliant play, your airy fabric may
vanish.</p>

<p>Therefore by all means choose such
moves as will most readily lead him to
divine your method of attack, bearing in
mind that it is more important he should
know it than that your adversaries should
remain in ignorance of it.</p>

<p>Since the attack should invariably be
made on the right-hand adversary, and the
great danger is that you may be held in
check by one foe while the other sweeps
away your pieces, it is obvious that your
left-hand defence must be of double
strength, to prevent this result being obtained.
Your knights in the early stages
of the game will be found of value in this
respect, and your bishops and queen
should, as far as possible, be kept in readiness
to swoop to your partner&#8217;s assistance,
while he will be ready to aid you in a
similar manner. Get out your castles as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
speedily as possible, even if you sacrifice
a pawn in doing so, as they are of more
importance in this game than in Single
Chess, and are not nearly so well protected
in their original positions. Your
queen is of far more value than in Single
Chess, and to capture her the sacrifice of
a castle and bishop is, in our opinion, not
too great.</p>

<p>Great care must be exercised in her
movements. Calculate well, ere you place
her in position, that you cannot be checked
in two moves, or you lose her to a certainty.</p>

<p>We place the relative value of the
pieces in Double Chess in the following
scale<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="noindent">although practically the last are of little
value; certainly not half so valuable as in
Single Chess.</p>

<p>Other players may place a slightly
different value on the pieces, but this will
in a great measure depend on their play.
While some work the queen to death,
others rely more on their other pieces&mdash;in
our opinion the wisest play in the long
run.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">THE BOARD AND MEN.</h5>

<p>We have found a board of two-inch
squares suit our purpose, and those which
fold in the centre, leaving a blank in each
corner, seem to us the handiest.</p>

<p>If bone black and white and red and
green men cannot be obtained easily, the
ordinary wooden black and yellow, and
bone red and white, will answer the purpose
just as well, but any turner will turn
a double set for about two pounds.</p>

<p>Captain George Hope Verney says, in
his <i>Four-Handed Chess</i><span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8216;I use two sets of Staunton men. One
set is of black and yellow wood, and the
other is of red and white bone.</p>

<p>&#8216;The latter was made to order for me
at the Civil Service Store in the Haymarket,
at a cost of about eighteen
shillings.&#8217;</p>

<p>The base of the king measures one and
five-eighths of an inch, and is three and a
half inches high.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">EXAMPLES IN OPENING.</h5>

<p>First round&mdash;Black king&#8217;s pawn to
king&#8217;s third; green ditto; white ditto; red
ditto.</p>

<p>Second round&mdash;Black bishop takes red
bishop; green queen takes black queen;
white queen takes red queen; red king
takes white queen.</p>

<p>Third round&mdash;Black king takes green
queen; green moves queen&#8217;s pawn one,
white king&#8217;s knight&#8217;s pawn one, red king&#8217;s
knight to royal square.</p>

<p>Fourth round&mdash;Bishop takes knight&#8217;s
pawn.</p>

<p>Thus at the beginning of the fourth round
red and green find themselves obliged
to put up with the loss of a bishop and
pawn, and a strong attack, to be followed
up by the knights, will be directed against
red, who is severely crippled. Should
green check black king, it will do him no
good, as black king&#8217;s bishop is protected
by white.</p>

<p>Red and green have drawn disaster
upon themselves at the beginning of the
game by imitating their opponents&#8217; move,
and black and white thus early starting
with an advantage and well-defined attack,
should win the game, since red has not
only lost a piece and pawn, but also a
move.</p>

<p>Should green check black king third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
round, he will lose his bishop. Should he
take white&#8217;s bishop, black will retreat
without breaking square, as that would
liberate red&#8217;s castle. He will thus save
his partner a pawn.</p>

<p>A variation of the same opening will be
for black second round to play his knight
to bishop&#8217;s third, thence to castle four.
If this opening is not seen through and
frustrated before four moves, green loses
his queen. But red can easily frustrate
the design, or green king&#8217;s bishop&#8217;s knight
to bishop&#8217;s third will suffice.</p>

<p>These two openings will suffice for the
beginner; and our readers can now follow
up the subject as far as they wish.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">CIRCULAR CHESS.</h5>

<p>Of chess in the middle ages there were
no less than fifty-four varieties&mdash;not gambits,
but different ways of playing the game.
To one of these, known as <a href="#Ref19">Double Chess</a>,
we have already devoted some pages;
and we now give the variety known as
Circular Chess, which was played on a
board of the same pattern as the <a href="#FigXII16">illustration</a>,
on which the pieces were arranged as
shown, the line with the arrow-heads
representing the edge of the board in the
ordinary game, and the movements taking
place right and left from it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXII16">
<img src="images/illo180.jpg" alt="circular chess" width="350" height="367" />
</div>

<p>A pawn attaining this line is exchangeable
for a piece, as in the common game,
but it offers no barrier to the passage of
the men. The moves are in all respects
the same as in ordinary chess. The
peculiarity of the shape, however, considerably
reduces the importance of the
bishops and increases that of the rooks
and queens.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;DRAUGHTS.<br />
<span class="smcap">By the late Captain Crawley.</span></h3>

<h4>I. <span class="smcap">All About the Game.</span></h4>

<p>It has been said by one who has a right
to express an opinion on the subject (Mr.
Wylie, of Fife, the greatest player and
analyst in Scotland) that Draughts is a
more intricate and ingenious game than
its proud rival, Chess, of higher antiquity
and of more intellectual scope. So much
so, that in a hundred years a man could
not exhaust its varieties. Edgar Allan
Poe, the author of <i>The Raven</i>, expresses
a like opinion: &#8216;The higher powers of the
reflective intellect are more decidedly
tasked by the unostentatious game of
Draughts, or chequers, than by all the
elaborate frivolities of Chess.&#8217;</p>

<p>Without venturing to discriminate between
the merits and claims of the two
games&mdash;both of which I love&mdash;I purpose
attempting to show my readers some of
the prominent features of the ancient and
honourable game of Draughts.</p>

<p>You are all, doubtless, acquainted with
the form of the draught-board and men;
with the fact that the game is played by
two persons on a board of sixty-four
squares, with twenty-four men, twelve of
one colour and twelve of another. At
starting, the men occupy the three rows of
squares on opposite sides of the board.
The men may be placed on either colour,
but for convenience of notation it is usual
to select the white squares. The moves
of all the men are alike&mdash;diagonal from
square to square, in an upward direction
from the player. They <i>take</i> by passing
over the captured man into a vacant square
beyond. One, two, or more men can be
taken by the same move, always providing
that there is a vacant square to pass into
at each jump. When a man has arrived
at either of the four squares on the opposite
side of the board he is crowned, and
becomes a King. The crowning is a
simple ceremony&mdash;merely placing one
draughtman, of the same colour, on the
top of the other. The kings have the
power of moving forward and backward,
one square at a time, diagonally. The
<i>object</i> of the game is to capture all your
opponent&#8217;s men, or so to block them in
that they cannot move. The player who
first accomplishes one of these ends wins
the game.</p>

<p>One or two rules are absolute. The
offered man must be taken, when the
player says &#8216;Take,&#8217; and a man touched
must, if it can, be moved.</p>

<p>In placing the board for the game, the
double corners must be at the right-hand
of the player, which brings us at once to
the</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">NOTATION OF DRAUGHTS</h5>

<p class="noindent">&mdash;the method by which the moves of a
game or problem are recorded. It is not
necessary to show a diagram of the
Numbered Board if you remember the
order of the figures. The first white
square on the left hand, uppermost, is 1,
and the rest go from left to right, horizontally,
till we arrive at the last white square
on the right, 32. In recording the moves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of a game we say 11 to 15, 24 to 19, and
so on. A very little practice will make
you sufficiently familiar with this easy
system of notation, and soon enable you
to play a game by memory without the
board.</p>

<p>To show you the nature of a Problem,
and the way to record its solution, I will
append a diagram.</p>

<p class="noindent">by which you will see that Black&#8217;s moves
are all forced, and White wins the game.</p>

<p>Draughts is played in three ways: the
Winning (and most usual) game, the
Losing, and the Polish game. The last,
not much practised in this country, is
played on a larger board, and the men
take backwards or forwards.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">THE RULES.</h5>

<p>Draughts, as played in Great Britain
and in all English-speaking countries, is
governed by a few simple and easily-understood
Rules, as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The board is to be placed with the
double corner to the right hand of the
player.</p>

<p>2. The choice of colour is determined
by lot. After the first game the men are
commonly changed.</p>

<p>3. Black has invariably the first move.</p>

<p>4. A man touched, except for the purpose
of adjusting it, must be moved if
there be an open square into which it can
be moved.</p>

<p>5. A man moved over the angle of a

<p>A common practice with young players
is to give man for man; but this is only
advantageous when you are a piece ahead,
and even then it is sometimes found difficult
to win within the twenty moves allowed.
There is, however, no secret in the matter.
The player with two kings can always
force a win if he knows how to set about
it. From any part of the board he can,
in about eight or nine moves, drive the
single king into the double corner, and
when he is there he wins in eight moves,

<p>Of course a like series of moves in the
other double corner produces a like result.</p>

<p>In the above, and all the other diagrams,
the Black men occupy the upper half of
the board.</p>

<p>To show, however, the mischief of unscientific
play, we will suppose the kings
to have got into the following position,

Black go to 25 instead of 17, he loses the
game in two moves. White moves to 26,
and pins him on 22, in either the three
squares to which he is compelled to go.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">TWO KINGS TO TWO.</h5>

<p>When you are left with three kings to
two, you must effect an exchange, or the
game may be prolonged indefinitely. It
is sometimes rather difficult to force an
exchange, but it is not impossible if you
go the right way to work. The possessor
of the two kings commonly gets one in
each double corner. The mode of attack
in this case is to get your three kings into
a line, so as to enable you to give king for
king. However hard the other player
tries he must eventually succumb. Take
a common case. Place the kings on the
board as in the <a href="#FigXIII08">diagram</a>, the White on 32
and 5, the Black on 10, 18, and 19<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Now, whether White move from 5 to 1

exchange, for Black backs up his king,
takes one for one, and then wins in the
usual way.</p>

<p>Suppose White has the move. He can
only go into squares 1 or 32. Say he
moves into 32; Black has only to go from
18 to 15, and what has his adversary left?

<p class="noindent">which leaves Black with two kings to one,
when he wins in ten or twelve moves.</p>

<p>This last is an instructive position, as it
shows how the greater force must conquer.
Generally the same result happens in other
and more vastly important contests. The
game of Draughts, like the game of war,
can only be successfully played by an intimate
union of strategy and might.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">THE MOVE.</h5>

<p>If each player had equal skill, and each
made the proper move, then the player
who took the first move would win. This
sentence sounds like a truism, but it is
open to argument. Throughout every
game it is important to know which of the
two players &#8216;has the move&#8217;&mdash;that is, the
power to fix his adversary man for man on
every available square. The first moves
of a game do not directly affect its final
result, but when the men have become
fewer and fewer, it is of the greatest consequence
to know on which side lies the
forcing power. To make this plain, place
a white man on square 4, the top right-hand
corner, and a black man on square
30, the second from the left in the lowermost
row of squares. Black, having to
play, moves from 30 to 26, and do what
he may, White must be stopped at square
19. Try it. White, having to play first,
cannot, on the contrary, prevent his
opponent from making a king. This
simply shows the theory of Having the
Move.</p>

<p>To discover whether you Have the
Move, several plans are at your service.
The easiest is this: Count one for each
man of both colours which stand on
columns having a white square at the
foot. If it is your turn, and the total of
the addition be odd, you Have the Move;
if it is your opponent&#8217;s turn to play, the
move is with him.</p>

<p>Place the men as in the following
<a href="#FigXIII10">diagram</a>, and you will soon find that either
colour moving first has the move, and
therefore ought to win.</p>

<div class="figc300" id="FigXIII10">
<img src="images/illo186.png" alt="draughts" width="300" height="344" />
<p class="caption">The Move.&mdash;Either colour to play first
and Have the Move.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Another Plan</i>, by some considered more
certain, is this<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>If you desire to know if any one of your
men has the move of any man on the
other side, examine the position of both.
If there is a black square on the right
angle under his man you Have the Move.
For instance, you have a black man on
30, and white has a man on 3. The right
angle is the black square between 31 and
32. With your man on square 29 or 31
the right angle would be found on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
black squares on one or other side of the
straight line below the white man, and he,
therefore, would Have the Move. The
value of this plan is that it holds good
with any number of men.</p>

<p><i>A Third Plan.</i>&mdash;Count the men and
the squares. If the men are even and the
squares are odd, or if the squares are even
and the men odd, <i>you</i> Have the Move.
With even men and even squares, and
odd men and odd squares, the move is on
the other side.</p>

<p>To apply this theory. When you have
the move do <i>not</i> exchange, if you can
avoid it, or you may lose the move. For
example, place the men thus:</p>

<div class="figc300" id="FigXIII11">
<img src="images/illo187a.png" alt="draughts" width="300" height="364" />
<p class="caption">The Move.&mdash;White to play and win.</p>
</div>

<p>When all the men, both Black and
White, on the lettered column (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>,)
are added up, the total is <i>odd</i>, and the
side having to play Has the Move. If no
men are on the lettered squares, then take
the figured squares, 1, 2, 3, 4; but do <i>not</i>
combine the two. Apply the theory to
the above position. We find that there
being 9, an odd number of men, on the
lettered columns, White Has the Move,
and having it, would win:</p>

<p>The beginner who follows the moves of
this game with an understanding brain,
will learn more about the scientific theory
of Draughts than he could acquire by a
year of miscellaneous play.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">COMMENTS ON THE LAWS.</h5>

<p>As stated on <a href="#Page_182">page 182</a>, the rules are
few and simple. The explanations and
remarks are in brackets.</p>

<p>1. The board is to be so placed as that
the double corner is at the right hand of
the player. [Some play on the white, and
some on the black squares. For convenience
of numbering the board and recording
the moves, the white squares are now
generally adopted.]</p>

<p>2. The choice of colour is determined
by lot, and the men on either side are
placed on the alternate squares in three
lines immediately in front of the player.
[The black or the white squares, as may
be decided before starting.]</p>

<p>3. Black has the first move, and the
men are changed with each game. [Thus
giving in turn the first move to each
player.]</p>

<p>4. The player who touches a man,
except for the purpose of adjusting it,
must move that man, if it can be legally
moved.</p>

<p>5. A piece moved over the angle of a
square must be moved to that square.
[This is a newly-adopted law, to prevent
the undecided mode of moving backward
and forward adopted by some players.]</p>

<p>6. A man <i>en prise</i> must be taken if intimation
be given by the player offering
it. If by accident it is left untaken, the
piece which should have taken it may be
huffed. [It is at the option of the adversary
to huff or let the offending piece
remain.]</p>

<p>7. The player cannot stand the huff,
when he is told to take a man, or men.</p>

<p>8. The huff is not a move; and after
taking off the huffed piece, the player
moves. [Thus &#8216;huff and move&#8217; is a well-understood
direction.]</p>

<p id="DrRule09">9. A player taking one piece only when
two or more can be legally taken, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
be huffed on the completion of his
move.</p>

<p>10. When a piece is <i>en prise</i> it must be
taken within a minute. [This is to prevent
the delay in which some indulge.]</p>

<p>11. Five minutes is the limit of time
for considering a move. The penalty for
exceeding the time allowed is loss of the
game. [This law applies more particularly
to match games.]</p>

<p>12. A piece abandoned is a completed
move. [In all games this law should be
observed, as nothing is so annoying to an
opponent as to be asked to allow a move
to be amended.]</p>

<p>13. A false or illegal move must be
rectified, or the game resigned; such
move may be allowed to remain, at the
option of the adversary. [By a false move
is meant the moving backward, or sideways,
or on to the wrong-colour square.]</p>

<p>14. If a player in the act of taking
remove one of his own men from the
board, it cannot be replaced, except by
consent of the opponent.</p>

<p>15. When three or more kings are
opposed to a weaker force, the game must,
when the opponent gives notice to count,
be won within forty moves, or abandoned
as drawn.</p>

<p>16. When two kings are opposed to
one, the game is to be declared drawn,
unless the player with the stronger force
win in twenty moves. [From any part of
the board two kings can win against one
in fifteen or sixteen moves.]</p>

<p>17. Notice must be given of the intention
to count the moves. [Twenty or
forty, as the case may be; one for the
combined move of both colours.]</p>

<p>18. When several pieces can be taken
in one continuous move, no piece may be
taken up off the board until the move is
completed. The player failing to take all
the men may be huffed. [As in <a href="#DrRule09">Rule 9</a>.]</p>

<p>19. When a man arrives at a square in
the last row on the opposite side of the
board, he must be immediately crowned.
But the king cannot move till the opposing
player has made his move.</p>

<p>20. Kings can move backward or forward,
one square at a time only; and, to
take two or more pieces in one move,
there must be a vacant square behind each
individual piece.</p>

<p>21. Disputes are to be decided by an
umpire, or a majority of the company.</p>

<p>22. Matches must consist, unless otherwise
agreed, of an equal number of games.
[The rules for regulating a match should
be determined and stated in writing. An
umpire should be appointed.]</p>

<p>23. During the progress of a game
neither player is allowed to leave the room,
except by permission of his opponent.</p>

<p>24. Pointing over the board, loud talk,
or any other behaviour likely to annoy or
confuse an adversary, if persisted in,
forfeits the game.</p>

<p>25. No bystander is allowed to advise
a player, or interfere with the progress of
a game.</p>

<p>26. A breach of any of the above laws
is punishable by the loss of the game, if
in the opinion of the umpire such breach
was intentional.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">ADVICE TO YOUNG PLAYERS.</h5>

<p>Play with better players than yourself.
Observe the openings.</p>

<p>Look well over the board before making
a move.</p>

<p>Never touch a man without moving it.</p>

<p>Leave off when your mind is fatigued,
and never persist in playing when you
stand but small chance of winning.</p>

<p>Waste no time in considering an inevitable
move. Take the offered piece without
hesitation or delay.</p>

<p>When you are a man ahead, exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
as often as you can, but at the same time
beware of man-traps and spring-guns.</p>

<p>Abandon a line of play the secret of
which is discovered by your adversary;
and when a piece must be lost, make no
attempt to retain it. Sometimes it is safer
to give up a man than to defend a weak
position.</p>

<p>Make your kings as quickly as you can.
Avoid all cramped positions. Back up
your men in phalanx fashion<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXIII13">
<img src="images/illo190a.png" alt="draughts" width="300" height="349" />
</div>

<p class="noindent">and move rather towards the centre than
to the sides of the board. Be careful not
to move out your men too soon from the
safety of the back row.</p>

<p>Play with your head as well as with
your fingers. Avoid banter and loud talk.
Boast not of your victories. Win modestly,
and lose with good temper. Punctuality
is the politeness of kings. Courtesy is
the grand characteristic of good draught-players.</p>

<h4>II. <span class="smcap">The Losing Game.</span></h4>

<p>There is a good deal of amusement and
no little skill in the Losing Game. As its
name denotes, this game is the reverse of
Draughts proper. The object is to lose
all your men; and he who accomplishes
that object wins.</p>

<p>The whole or main secret of the Losing
Game is to play towards the sides of the
board, and to so arrange your men as to
be able to give up two, three, or more at
a single <i>coup</i>. After a little practice you
will discover that even with a dozen men
on the board against, say, two or three,
you may win&mdash;that is, you may compel
your adversary to take them all. Or with
a single king you may take man after
man, and then, at last, commit graceful
suicide. Or you may compel a king to
take several men. Much depends on
Having the Move. <a href="#FigXIII14">Here</a>, for instance, is
a position in which a king is forced to
take eight men and lose the game<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figc300" id="FigXIII14">
<img src="images/illo190b.png" alt="draughts" width="300" height="346" />
<p class="caption">Black to move and White to win, or White
to move and Black to win.</p>
</div>

<p>Black has only two squares into which
he can go, and then he must allow White
to give away his men one after the other.
If White moves first, Black gains the
opposition by losing his king, and wins
the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>In the next <a href="#FigXIII15">diagram</a>, again, is a position
in which White can compel a single Black
man to take all his eleven pieces one after
the other.</p>

<div class="figc300" id="FigXIII15">
<img src="images/illo191.png" alt="draughts" width="300" height="341" />
<p class="caption">White to play and win.</p>
</div>

<p>White, moving upward, first gives his
king, and then the man on 24, after which
he offers the man on 31, which White
must take and become a king. The remaining
moves are simple, but White has
to play carefully, or he may enable the
Black king to sacrifice himself and win.</p>

<p>The Losing Game offers numerous
opportunities for calculation and combination;
but what we have shown is sufficient
to enable young players to understand
the theory. Excellence will come
with practice and perseverance.</p>

<h4>III. <span class="smcap">Polish Draughts.</span></h4>

<p>The Polish game is played on a board
of a hundred squares, ten each way; but
for all ordinary purposes the regular
English board of sixty-four squares will
do as well. The board is set in the usual
way, with a double corner at the right
hand of the players, no matter which
colour be chosen.</p>

<p>Two great and essential differences
exist between English and Polish Draughts.
In the foreign game the men <i>take backward
and forward</i>, one square at a time,
as many pieces as are <i>en prise</i>, and the
kings <i>leap over any number of squares</i>,
wherever and whenever there is a piece to
take. As, in our own game, a piece
touched must be moved, and all the other
rules of the English game are to be
observed. On the Continent, where the
game is much more common than with
us, the crowned man is called a queen,
just as the game itself is Damen, a game
for ladies. With them, as with us, the
White squares are usually chosen.</p>

<p>It is by exchanges that good players at
Polish Draughts parry moves and prepare
combinations. It is well to give man for
man, or two for two. By that means the
game is strengthened, and thus it often
happens that a single man can confine
several of his opponent&#8217;s pieces.</p>

<p>The <i>lunette</i>&mdash;the placing a man on a
square between two men of the other
side&mdash;is much more frequent in the
Polish than in the English game. Look
well to the position before you enter the
<i>lunette</i>; and having entered it, before
you decide on your move. It is often a
snare, which the good player will try to
avoid.</p>

<p>Concentrate your men towards the end
of the game, for then the slightest error
may be fatal.</p>

<p>Two, three, or more pieces may sometimes
be advantageously sacrificed to
obtain a king, which, in this game, is very
powerful. Make your kings as soon as
you can, and play them with judgment.
With a king and a man against two or
three kings, hesitate not to sacrifice your
man, for the game may be almost as well
defended by the king alone. Between
equal players, the game often results in a
draw; but there is no saying how nume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>rous
are the combinations which may lead
to victory or its reverse.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to give the moves of
a game, as, except for its two grand distinctions,
Polish Draughts is similar to
the English game.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have pretty well all that
can be taught on paper respecting this
branch of the game. The next step is
How to Open a game with advantage.
This I shall proceed briefly to show; and
after that the excellence is to be acquired
by practice alone. Draughts, in all its
varieties, is an admirable game, inculcating
patience, caution, tact, and scientific
calculation. Those who would excel in
its practice must be content to go slowly.
There is no royal road to Draughts. Perseverance
and failure are the parents of
success.</p>

<h4>THE OPENINGS.</h4>

<p>Usually it is necessary to begin at the
beginning; but in Draughts and Chess,
as in other games of skill, players commence
playing, and even attain some
degree of aptness, before they actually
conquer the alphabet, the science, of the
several amusements. There is no great
harm in this plan, however. Do we not
all learn to talk before we know anything
of grammar or orthography; to sing before
we understand even the notation of music;
to argue and discuss before we get even
the haziest notion of logic? Of course we
do. And then we naturally endeavour
to go back to first principles, and so
correct our mistakes by aid of rule and
system.</p>

<p>I told you some pages back that there
were various accepted openings to the
game of Draughts&mdash;the Old Fourteenth,
the Single Corner, the Laird and Lady,
the Glasgow, the Whilter, and some fifty
others. All the really safe, sound, and
favourable openings, however, proceed
from the five here named. The rest are
well enough to know, but in practice they
are risky and fantastical.</p>

<p>To properly understand what follows, it
is necessary that you should so completely
conquer the notation of draughts as to be
able to follow the moves in your mind&#8217;s
eye without seeing the board. This is
not nearly so difficult as you may think.
Number your board as in the diagram
below, and place the men in the order of
play.</p>

<div class="figc300" id="FigXIII16">

<p class="caption">The Numbered Board, with the men placed
in their order of play.</p>
</div>

<p>Here we have the Black men on the
upper half of the board, though whether
the White or the Black occupy that position
the order of their moves is the
same. The usual plan is for the Black
to take the first move, and for the
players to change the pieces with each
game. By this method each player begins
alternately, and always with the Black
men. Our games will be so arranged, if
you please.</p>

<p>Let us commence, then, with the best
of the openings&mdash;</p>

<p>These three moves on either side constitute
the Old Fourteenth Opening. From this
point, at which the game is perfectly even,
spring many variations. The most common
and accepted moves on each side
are&mdash;</p>

<p>The following is now the position. Both
sides are well placed, and the game, if
played thoroughly, should end in a draw,
with White for preference.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXIII17">
<img src="images/illo193.png" alt="draughts" width="300" height="345" />
</div>

<p>Black has now the choice of two moves.
We will suppose that he defends his
position by moving from 9 to 14.</p>

<p>The first double column gives the moves
from the position in the diagram; six
moves on each side having been made.
The other columns show six variations.
The star indicates the losing move in
each case.</p>

<p>If you play out these games carefully
you will see that there is a reason for each
move, and thus demonstrate that Draughts
is a scientific game possessing no element
of luck or chance.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">THE LAIRD AND LADY.</h5>

<p>The opening known as the Laird and
Lady is a favourite with players north of
the Tweed. Rare fine players at Draughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
are the Scotsmen. They carried the game
across the Atlantic, where it is popularly
known as Checquers, or, as the New
Englanders spell it, Checkers.</p>

<p>The first two moves on each side in
the Laird and Lady are the same as those
in the Old Fourteenth.</p>

<p>White&#8217;s last move supports the advanced
man on square 14. Then Black proceeds
with what at first sight seems a weak
move<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>From this point the game is even,
though the advantage would certainly
seem to be on the side of the White.
The following is the position at the point
arrived at<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXIII18">
<img src="images/illo194.png" alt="draughts" width="300" height="343" />
</div>

<p>From this position there are almost
endless variations. Drummond, a well-known
writer and specialist, gives no
fewer than thirty; and, generally, they
end in favour of White, the second player&mdash;proving
that this opening is hardly so
good as the Old Fourteenth or the Single
Corner, which may be considered the
standard games of first-rate players.</p>

<p>We give the moves of a completed
game in this opening, showing the moves
from which the variations spring.</p>

<p class="noindent">Of these, some already named&mdash;Old Fourteenth,
Laird and Lady, &amp;c.&mdash;are the best
for practice. We therefore present another
set of games in the</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">OLD FOURTEENTH.</h5>

<p>As before, the key-game appears in the
first double-column; and the variations
spring from the point indicated. The
moves are given consecutively; the first
player going from 11 to 15; his opponent
from 23 to 19, and so on to the end.</p>

<p class="noindent">As in the previous examples, the asterisk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
shows the losing move. Young players
should get this opening by heart. In the
first game, you see, all that White can do
is to draw; in the others he wins.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">THE SINGLE CORNER GAME.</h5>

<p>This a good and sound opening. Properly
conducted, it gives the win to the
first player. As in the Old Fourteenth
and the Laird and Lady, the first move is
from square 11 to square 15. The variation
occurs in the second move, which is
22 to 18 instead of 22 to 19. Thus&mdash;</p>

<p>The position of the men is now as
follows, without any great advantage on
either side, with Black to move<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It will be well for the students to play
out the game from this position.</p>

<p>Now let us take some variations most
usual in this opening. The first game is
played from the initial move, and the
variations from the places marked. It
will be easy for any two players with the
Numbered Board before them to follow
the moves.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">THE GLASGOW OPENING.</h5>

<p>This mode of opening the game was,
and is, a favourite one with Scottish
players. It is a strong and sound game
for the Black, beginning, like the Old
Fourteenth, the Single Corner, and the
Laird and Lady, with the move from
square 11 to square 15. Presuming that
Black always commences, the first moves

by moving into square 20, compelled
White to go from 24 to 19, and have
gained the exchange by giving the man
on 10. Therefore 30 to 25 is the best.</p>

Apparently he must lose a man, but by
moving 16 to 19 he forces an exchange,
which leaves him either even or a man
ahead, according to White&#8217;s play. He
moves from 16 to 19, and White may
either take the man on 11 or the two men
on 19 and 11.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.&mdash;SOLITAIRE.<br />
<span class="smcap">By the late Captain Crawley.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">As a game for one player there is no
superior to Solitaire. Apparently easy
and simple, it is really intricate and scientific.
Governed by a well-defined principle,
chance forms no element of its
practice. Like Chess and Draughts, it is
entirely a mental and demonstrable game,
full of variety, and affording ample scope,
in its almost endless combinations, for the
display of thought and ingenuity.</p>

<p>Solitaire is played on a board of thirty-three
holes, in each of which a marble or
glass ball is placed. Solitaire boards are
made, but the game may be just as efficiently
played on a properly marked
piece of card-board, with draughtsmen or
counters instead of marbles. This plan,
indeed, is preferable to and cheaper than
any other.</p>

<p>The method of play is as follows:&mdash;One
marble is removed from its place,
and then another is passed into the
vacant hole. Take up the marble over
which you jump, and continue to take piece
after piece, <i>always going in straight lines
and never in diagonals</i>, till you bring back
the last marble from the hole whence the
first was taken. One marble only can be
taken at one jump; but, as in Draughts, you
may proceed to play, and take, with the
same marble, so long as there is a piece
<i>en prise</i> with a vacant hole in the line
behind it. The repetition of the figures
will show the continued move of the
piece.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Centre-hole Game.</span></p>
</div>

<p>There are other modes of playing
Solitaire&mdash;as by indicating a special hole,
distinct from the starting-place, in which
to lodge the last marble, leaving two,
three, or four marbles in a particular
position, ending in the hole next the
original one, and so on; but the above, the
more usual plan, should be first learned.
We will now give a <a href="#FigXIV01">diagram</a>, and show
you how to start from and return to the
centre hole. Remove the centre marble.
Jump from 1 in the upper limb to 1, the
middle hole, taking 16-18. Go from 2
on the right limb of the diagram to 2
above the centre, taking 3-5. Proceed
from hole to hole as indicated by the
figures, and you will find that the last
move will land the marble in the
centre. Practise this till you can play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the Centre-hole Game without the use of
the diagram. It looks easy enough; but
just try it before you condemn Solitaire
as mere child&#8217;s play.</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">GAME II.</h4>

<p>Presuming you have familiarised yourselves
with the principle of the game, I
present another diagram<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<img src="images/illo200a.png" alt="solitaire" width="400" height="397" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Right-hand End Game.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Remove the marble from the upper
right-hand corner hole and proceed as
before, going from place to place, as
shown by the figures on the diagram. Get
this by heart, and play the game without
the problem.</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">GAME III.</h4>

<p>In this, one of the best positions, remove
the left-hand upper marble, and
play the game according to the plan in the
diagram below. You will find this an
easy game to remember.</p>

<div class="figc400" id="FigXIV03">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Left-hand End Game.</span></p>
</div>

<p>This may be altered by ending in any
other hole. You should, however, thoroughly
conquer the game as presented
before you attempt any variation. It is
not sufficient to play with the diagram
before you. The problem is presented as
a game to be learned, and once thoroughly
learned, it is difficult to forget it.</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">GAME IV.</h4>

<p>The following is a pretty but somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
difficult position. It will be sufficient to
give the diagram without remark other than
this: Conquer it before you leave off,
and do not be disheartened if you fail to
succeed the first time you attempt it without
the diagram.</p>

</div>

<h4 class="fsize80">GAME V.</h4>

<p>You will understand that these positions
given may be varied by starting from a
similar place in either leg of the board.
It is sufficient to mention this. To give
players many variations would occupy too
much space.</p>

</div>

<h4 class="fsize80">GAME VI.</h4>

<p>Here we have one of the most difficult
and yet most interesting of positions.
Proceed as before, taking care to learn
the game so as to play without the numbered
diagram. Remove the black marble.</p>

<p>Solitaire may also be played by two
persons, the object of one of them being
to defeat the other by contrary or opposite
moves. Double Solitaire is, however,
somewhat deficient in the one great element
of all antagonistic games&mdash;variety.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.&mdash;FOX AND GEESE.<br />
<span class="smcap">By the late Captain Crawley.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">I am not sure that this game was not
played by the boys of ancient Greece and
Rome; or perhaps even by boys in a yet
earlier age of the world. At any rate, it
is a very, very old game, of whose origin
nothing whatever is known. Under these
circumstances, it would be easy to gossip
on for a page or two, and talk about anything
likely to seem interesting; but it is
pleasanter, and much more practical, to
tell you how, with the assistance of our
Solitaire-board, and some draughtsmen or
counters of wood, bone, or metal, you
may play it yourselves.</p>

<p>For Fox and Geese you need seventeen
counters of one colour, to represent the
Geese, and one counter of a different
colour for the Fox. You prepare the
board thus: place the Fox in the middle
and the Geese in front, as in the <a href="#FigXV01">diagram</a>
below.</p>

<div class="figc350" id="FigXV01">
<img src="images/illo202.png" alt="fox and geese" width="350" height="341" />
<p class="caption">THE BOARD WITH THE PIECES SET FOR THE
GAME.</p>
</div>

<p>Like Chess and Draughts, it is purely a
game of strategy for two players. The
usual plan is for each player to take the
initiative in turn, the Fox in one game
and the Geese in another. Unlike card
games, it contains no element of chance
or &#8216;luck.&#8217;</p>

<p>The whole <i>motive</i> of the game is for the
Fox to catch the Geese, or for the Geese
to drive the Fox into a corner from which
he cannot escape. Properly played, the
Geese, with the first move, must always
win; but in this game, as in real life, the
more cunning creature is not seldom successful.</p>

<p>The <i>plan</i> of the game is this. The
Geese march <i>forward</i> only in straight
lines, down or across; the Fox can move
forward, backward, or sideways on the
straight lines, not the diagonals. The
Fox takes any Goose that may be <i>en
prise</i> with a vacant space behind, as in
Draughts; and so long as he can take, he
continues his move. When he succeeds
in following up and catching all the Geese,
one after another, he wins. But the
Geese, if they only go boldly to work,
can drive him away. They must go
forward as a phalanx with determination,
filling each vacant spot, and leaving no
loophole into which the enemy can jump
or creep. All depends on united and
determined action. United they conquer;
separated they fall. When their number is
reduced to six, it is impossible for them to
confine the Fox. But there is no reason
why it should be so reduced. Look at
the <a href="#FigXV01">diagram</a>. If we call the upper left-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>hand
spot 1, and number the board horizontally
to 33, at the lower right-hand
corner, we shall soon see how the attack
may be conducted. The Fox is in the
centre; the Goose on either of the central
junction lines can move without fear of
capture, and the Fox must retreat. Having,
say, moved 11 to 18, the Goose on 6
moves on to 11. The Fox is still without
power to harm. The Geese proceed to
go forward, and in this way ultimately
force their enemy into a corner, or they
may beguile him by offering a bait.
Say the Goose on 15 moves to 16, the
Fox must take him and lose his central
position of attack. The Geese follow up
their advantage; and, unless they commit
some grievous error, they pin Master
Reynard in a corner, whence he can by
no means get out. The whole principle
of the game is Advance. Go forward
with the stronger force; fill up all
vacancies. Directly a Goose moves on,
back him up. Surround your enemy and
compel him to retreat. As to the Fox,
his tactics must be bold, yet cautious;
determined, yet crafty; daring, yet subtle;
adventurous, yet shrewd! Very like real
life, is it not?</p>

<p>The game can be varied by placing the
Fox on another spot; or by insisting
on his catching all the Geese; by the
latter taking the horizontal limits of the
board only, or by offering odds, and so
on; but the plan here given will be found
ample in providing rational amusement
for winter evenings. Less scientific, certainly,
than Chess or Draughts, it affords
abundant opportunities for thought and
mental calculation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.&mdash;GO-BAN.<br />
<span class="smcap">By Herr Meyer.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">This game is of Japanese origin, and the
name means Go = five, and Ban = board.
It has, however, become gradually corrupted
into &#8216;Go-bang,&#8217; and thus it is now
generally written.</p>

<p>In Japan it is played on a board of
more than three hundred squares, but in
Europe on boards of sixty-four squares
(as in chess and draughts), or on larger
boards. The Japanese have schools for
the study and practice of the game, and
divide the players into nine classes. A
late account says that at present there is
no player of the highest (the ninth) class
living; but one of the eighth class, named
Murase (in German spelling pronounced
Moo-r&#259;h-sey), is editing a periodical, in
which he publishes the theory of the openings,
actual games, problems, poems, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This game of Go (or game of five) is
in China called Ki (= Kee), and was
invented there about 2,000 years <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> It
is therefore older than chess. It was introduced
into Japan about 1,100 years ago,
and was there brought to higher perfection.</p>

<p>It is played by two persons. In Japan
they use more than a hundred men on
each side. If played on the <i>chess-board</i>,
then generally one plays with <i>twelve white
men</i>, the other with <i>twelve black men</i>. The
aim of each player is to get <i>five men in a
line</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, five of his men close together in
a straight line, either in row, a file, or a
diagonal. In Japan each player tries to
form a chain with his men around the
others, etc.</p>

<p>The play is carried on thus:&mdash;The
players decide as to first move; afterwards
they begin alternately. The first
player, say White, places a man on any of
the sixty-four squares, then Black places a
man on any of the remaining sixty-three
squares: thereupon White puts down his
second man on any unoccupied square,
and so on until all the twenty-four men
are placed. Now the moving begins.
The first player moves one of his men to
any of the <i>next</i> unoccupied squares, but
must not leap over a man, and the second
player proceeds in the same manner. So
the play continues until one or the other
succeeds in getting five men in a line.</p>

<p>Thus the play consists in <i>placing</i> and
<i>moving</i>. If a player be not sufficiently
attentive he can lose in the first part of
the game. The moving may extend from
two or three to any number, according
to capacity of the players.</p>

<p>The game requires a great deal of
watching, for the &#8216;Go,&#8217; or &#8216;Five,&#8217; can
be made in any of four directions&mdash;horizontally,
vertically, or on the right and
left diagonals. There are eight lines for
each of the two straight ways, and seven
lines for each of the two diagonal ways;
in all thirty lines. Four positions of the
&#8216;five&#8217; are possible in a row or a file, and
as many in each of the longest diagonals,
whilst the shortest diagonal permits of
only one position, so that the number of
all positions is 4 &times; 8 + 4 &times; 8 + 2 (4 + 3 + 3
+ 2 + 2 + 1 + 1) = 96.</p>

<p>Many players prefer this game to
draughts. It may also be played by four
persons, taking partners as in &#8216;whist,&#8217;
when each player receives six men. Odds
can be given in this game, a superior
player having eleven against twelve men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Whenever a player has three men in an
open line the opponent must stop him, for
should he get four, then the adversary
could block him on only one end. This
blocking, however, is not necessary if the
second player can first make &#8216;five.&#8217;</p>

<p>The student will learn the method of
playing from the games we shall give with
explanations. The system of description is
the International Chess Notation, as will
be shown on the frame of the diagram to
follow. The letters in brackets after the
moves will refer to the explanatory notes.</p>

<p id="GoNote1i">(<i>i</i>) Experience has shown that it is best
to occupy the central squares, for the men
then have the greatest freedom of action.</p>

<p id="GoNote1j">(<i>j</i>) This move is necessary, for if
Black had placed the man on c5, White
would have won by placing his next man
on c4 or g4.</p>

<p id="GoNote1k">(<i>k</i>) He must block the line at a2 g8,
just as well as Black must now block the
f file.</p>

<p id="GoNote1l">(<i>l</i>) The last six moves were all forced
for Black.</p>

<p id="GoNote1m">(<i>m</i>) A weak move, which places the
black men awkwardly. He would have
done better to place it on b3 in order
to force the last white man to go to a2,
and then Black could have placed his
last on c3, and try to make a &#8216;five&#8217; in
the a5 e1 or the a6 f1 or the c file.</p>

<p id="GoNote1n">(<i>n</i>) Necessary, for if placed on b6 or a5,
White would have won thus:&mdash;g6 g7, f6
g6, g5 f6, followed by g7 f8.</p>

<p id="GoNote1o">(<i>o</i>) Endeavouring to bring this man to
the other side of the board.</p>

<p id="GoNote1p">(<i>p</i>) He is afraid of e1 e2.</p>

<p id="GoNote1q">(<i>q</i>) A bad move, for although he can
block at h6, he can afterwards not stop
the g or f file. Black should have tried
to move from c6 to a2.</p>

<p id="GoNote1r">(<i>r</i>) Must. White now wins easily, even
if e6 stood on e7, for g6 g7, e7 f8, f7 g8,

<p>It appears at first sight that White
might now place his last man on h8 and
win. Black would then be obliged to
place his last man on f6. White would
continue f5 g4, and Black must answer
h7 g8, and White would now win with e5
f5, followed by h8 h7, if Black could not
play e7 f7 and come first in making &#8216;five&#8217;
in the diagonal a2 g8. To prevent these
&#8216;five&#8217; of Black, White would have to
play g7 f7 (instead of e5 f5), and then
Black would win easily by c3 b2, followed
by e3 f2. White therefore must place his
last man so that he can at once stop the
approaching line of &#8216;five&#8217; in the second
row. He might place it on f2, but does
better to put it on g3, and thus compel
the last black man to go to g4. Therefore
the game went on thus:</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.&mdash;THE MALAGASY GAME OF FAN&Ograve;RONA.<br />
<span class="smcap">By W. Montgomery.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">Nobody can very long reside in Madagascar,
or in the central parts of it at any
rate, without occasionally observing little
companies of the natives bending eagerly
over some mathematical-looking diagram
rudely scratched on a roadside stone, or on
the top of a rock, or, more roughly still, on
the sun-baked clay of the wayside. If you
look a little at the figure of the diagram,
and consider the multiplicity of squares,
diagonals, and adjacent parallelograms involved
in it, you may think the people are
discussing some Malagasy rider to one or
other of the propositions in the Second
Book of Euclid. Take the trouble to ask,
however, and you will find that they are
simply playing at their national game, the
<i>Fan&ograve;rona</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXVII01">
<img src="images/illo208.png" alt="fanorona" width="600" height="307" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram 1.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The <i>fan&ograve;rona</i> board is a rectangular
parallelogram, divided into thirty-two
equal spaces. Gather these, in your eye,
into eight larger squares, containing four
each; draw the diagonal lines in each
of the eight, and the <i>fan&ograve;rona</i> figure is
complete. Forty-four movable pieces are
required for the game&mdash;twenty-two on each
side.</p>

<p>With the Malagasy these are usually
little pebbles and potsherds, or beans and
berries. We, however, will call them the
Black and the White pieces. The two
players sit opposite each other, having the
long sides of the <i>fan&ograve;rona</i> adjacent to them.
The pieces are then arranged on the
corners or angle-points; not on the
squares, as in chess or draughts. There
are five of these long lines on the board,
each containing, of course, nine angle-points,
and the pieces are thus arranged:</p>

<table class="fsize80 nowrap" summary="fanorona game">

<tr>
<td rowspan="2" class="left top padr1">Black:</td>
<td class="left padr1">First</td>
<td class="center padr1">Line</td>
<td class="right">1</td>
<td class="center padl1 padr1">.. ..</td>
<td class="right">9</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left padr1">Second</td>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="right">1</td>
<td class="center padl1 padr1">.. ..</td>
<td class="right">9</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td rowspan="2" class="left top padr1">White:</td>
<td class="left padr1">Fourth</td>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="right">1</td>
<td class="center padl1 padr1">.. ..</td>
<td class="right">9</td>

<tr>
<td class="left padr1">Fifth</td>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="right">1</td>
<td class="center padl1 padr1">.. ..</td>
<td class="right">9</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>The third, or central line, is occupied by
the eight remaining pieces, placed alternately,
thus:</p>

<table class="fsize80 nowrap" summary="fanorona game">

<tr>
<td class="left padr1">Black</td>
<td class="left">1, 3, 6, 8</td>

<td class="left">2, 4, 7, 9</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>One point remains unoccupied, the central
angle-point of the board, the fifth of the
third line. This represents the royal seat
in the public gatherings, but in the <i>fan&ograve;rona</i>
game it is called the <i>foibeny</i>
(&#8216;navel&#8217;).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXVII02">
<img src="images/illo209.png" alt="fanorona" width="600" height="332" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram 2.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The object aimed at by each of the
players is, as in draughts, to remove the
whole of the adversary&#8217;s pieces from the
board. But much caution is required, for
we shall see that a few pieces well posted
may easily annihilate more than four times
their number in weaker situations; and, as
in real warfare, even the very numbers of a
force may sometimes prove their ruin. A
few examples here will show the various
ways in which the game may be opened,
the manner in which the pieces are moved,
and the adverse pieces captured. Let us
suppose that the pieces are all placed, as
just described above (see <a href="#FigXVII01">diagram 1</a>). For
convenience of description let the five
lines on which the pieces are posted be
called respectively A, B, C, D, E, instead
of first line, second line, third line, etc.
Any one of these letters, then, with a
numeral appended, will be an easy reference
to the piece that is to be moved, or
to the vacant point to which a piece has to
be removed, or to a hostile piece that has
to be captured and removed from the
board (see <a href="#FigXVII02">diagram 2</a>). Then remember:</p>

<p>Firstly, that a piece may be moved
in any direction,&mdash;forward, backwards,
sideways, or diagonally to the first station
in that direction, if such station be
vacant.</p>

<p>Secondly, if there be now no other
vacant station between the attacking piece
just moved and the enemy&#8217;s pieces along
that line, these, whatever their number,
are captured at once, as far as they
stand in unbroken order on the line
attacked. If, however, a vacant position
occurs in their line, or another hostile
piece is among them, then only the
piece or pieces nearest the assailant are
captured.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the pieces of the enemy may
be captured by a retreat as well as by an
advance. A piece that has been standing
in a station adjoining to some piece or
pieces of the enemy may capture it or
them by retreating one point along that
line, if such point happen to be vacant.
The limitation defined immediately above
applies in this case also.</p>

<p>Fourthly, at the beginning of a game
one move only is permitted to the first
side. After that side has moved once,
any piece that is moved is permitted to run
amuck in the enemy&#8217;s lines, and go on as
long as he finds foes to capture, provided
(<i>a</i>) that he does not return immediately to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
any point he has just left, and (<i>b</i>) he cannot
take a foe behind him immediately
after taking one in front of him, nor one
on his right hand immediately after taking
on his left hand, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. &#8216;Don&#8217;t
eat at both ends, like a leech,&#8217; says the
Malagasy proverb.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that White is going to
move first at the commencement of a
game. There is only one vacant point on
the board into which he can move a piece,
namely, the <i>foibeny</i> or central point, which
we may term C5, as it is the fifth point of
the third line. There are four white pieces,
any one of which may be moved into the
vacant post, those on C4, D4, D5, D6.
If he advances D5 to C5, then he immediately
captures Black&#8217;s pieces on B5 and
A5. Black may now retaliate by withdrawing
his piece on B6 to A5, thereby
capturing White&#8217;s pieces on C7, D8, E9.
White may now, in any one of several
ways, inflict a series of severe strokes on
the unfortunate Black. Thus, for example:</p>

<table class="fsize80 nowrap" summary="fanorona game">

<tr>
<td class="left padr1">D6, to</td>
<td class="left padr1">C7,</td>
<td class="center">taking</td>
<td class="left padl1">B8, A9; then</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="left padr1">B6,</td>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="left padl1">A5;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="left padr1">B5,</td>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="left padl1">B4, B3, B2, B1.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Now the White piece must stop awhile,
for although the Black piece at B7 is
under his range, yet in taking it he would
be transgressing the two laws mentioned
above. He would have to return to B6,
which he has just quitted, and he would
be &#8216;eating at both ends like a leech,&#8217;
which is improper. But the Black piece
on B7 may now very properly provide for
his own safety and circumvent his assailant
by advancing thus:</p>

<table class="fsize80" summary="fanorona game">

<tr>
<td class="left padl1">B7, to</td>
<td class="left padr1">C7,</td>
<td class="center">taking</td>
<td class="left padl1">D7, E7; then</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="left padr1">D6,</td>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="left padl1">E5; then</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="left padr1">D5,</td>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="left padl1">D4, D3, D2, D1; then</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="left padr1">E5,</td>
<td class="center">&#8222;</td>
<td class="left padl1">C5, B5.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>These moves are not given as examples
of what the Malagasy would consider
good play, but simply to show the
<i>modus operandi</i> of the game.</p>

<p>If the game happens to terminate in a
&#8216;draw,&#8217; which is frequently the case, then
the combat may be recommenced on the
same terms, the other side now taking the
first move. Should one of the players
have been defeated, however, he is not
allowed to play on the same footing as
before, for the game must be altered in a
kind of mocking condescension to his
weakness. The new form of the game is
called <i>v&eacute;la</i>; the one who has conquered is
the <i>mp&agrave;mpihinam-b&eacute;la</i> (he who allows to
graze at large). The defeated is <i>h&oacute;mam-b&eacute;la</i>
(a poor sheep not to be molested for
awhile in his pasture-ground). The <i>v&eacute;la</i>
game is opened by the vanquished, and
the victor exposes such of his pieces as he
chooses to surrender to his antagonist.
These pieces may only be taken singly, and
the generous conqueror refrains from
taking any of his enemy&#8217;s pieces until he
has parted with, one by one, seventeen of
his own; then with the remaining five he
begins his campaign against the undiminished
forces of his antagonist. If he
be a skilful player, however, he has
managed meanwhile to occupy the fortress
positions of the game, and the hosts of the
enemy are probably huddled together in
such situations that he will come down on
them &#8216;like a wolf on the fold.&#8217; If the
<i>h&oacute;mam-b&eacute;la</i> is again defeated he is only
allowed to play the <i>v&eacute;la</i> form of the game
until he has redeemed himself by a victory.
Or he may choose to humiliate himself
by openly confessing his inferiority, though,
as one of my informants says, &#8216;few of the
Malagasy are willing to do that.&#8217; In
ancient times grace was accorded to the
beaten combatant on condition of his
kneeling down before his conqueror and
bleating like a sheep (<i>mib&agrave;rar&egrave;oka</i>), in
confession of his weakness.</p>

<p>Here is a specimen of the <i>v&eacute;la</i> game,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
including the preliminary sacrificial moves
by which Black gives up, one by one, the
fated seventeen pieces. Then the time
of reprisals comes, and the five survivors
take the field, and give and take no
quarter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.&mdash;THE AMERICAN PUZZLES.</h3>

<p class="noindent">These puzzles, known as the &#8216;Thirty-four
Game&#8217; and the &#8216;Fifteen Game,&#8217; on
their introduction amongst us some years
ago, created general interest wherever
tried. Both games are played on the
same board. The &#8216;blocks&#8217; may be readily
made by any lad. They can be cut out of
cork, wood, or other suitable material, and
may be square or round in shape, the
numerals being written on the upper side,
thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXVIII01">
<img src="images/illo212a.png" alt="American puzzle" width="250" height="116" />
</div>

<p>Let us describe the &#8216;15&#8217; game first.
Place the blocks, numbered 1 to 15, on
the board irregularly, and then, by sliding
them about from square to square, but
without removing them from the board,
arrange them in the following order<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXVIII02">
<img src="images/illo212b.png" alt="American puzzle" width="350" height="317" />
</div>

<p>This looks simple enough in theory, but
to any uninitiated reader who may think it
easy of accomplishment in practice, we
need merely say, &#8216;Try it.&#8217;</p>

<p>The &#8216;34&#8217; puzzle consists in arranging
the blocks, numbered 1 to 16, so that they
will add perpendicularly, horizontally, and
from corner to corner; also in arranging
the 4 in each corner, the four outside
numbers of the two centre lines, and the
four groups in each corner; in all, sixteen
different ways, and each produce the same
total&mdash;34.</p>

<p>The &#8216;15&#8217; puzzle would appear to have
been, on its coming to England a few
years ago, strictly a new introduction, but
the &#8216;34&#8217; was not only tolerably well-known,
but seems to have been familiar to the
Arabs in the ninth century. The nature
of the game we have already described.</p>

<p>Now a word on the &#8216;15&#8217; game. A
skilful writer has pointed out how, while
with two figures only two different arrangements
can be obtained, three figures can
be placed in <i>six</i> different orders, viz.:&mdash;3
1 2&mdash;3 2 1; 1 3 2&mdash;2 3 1; 1 2 3&mdash;2 1 3.
Then, while there are thus six different
orders that can be produced with three
figures, if a fourth figure be placed in
every one of the four different positions
with regard to these six orders, we shall
have four times the different number of
orders that can be had with three figures.
In the same way by multiplying these
twenty-four different orders by five we shall
have the number to be obtained with five
figures. The rule, therefore, to find the
number of different orders that may be
obtained with any number of figures is to
multiply all the different numbers used by
each other. Thus, with six figures there
will be 720 different orders; with seven,
5,040; with eight, 40,320, and so forth
until we come to fifteen, when it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
found that the enormous number of
1,307,674,368,000 represents the different
orders in which the fifteen numbers can
be placed. This, of course, is the number
of arrangements in which the cubes in the
game of &#8216;15&#8217; can be placed in the box.
Let us consider how long it would take to
test the solution of the different arrangements
possible. Let us suppose that the
cubes were worked to their consecutive or
15&mdash;14 order at the rate of one in every
five minutes, which would, working day
and night, be at the rate of about 105,000
arrangements a year. In this case it
would take not less than twelve million
years to test all the different arrangements!</p>

<p>The question now arises, whether out
of this enormous number of different
arrangements there are certain of them
that cannot be shifted into the required
consecutive order. The answer is, that
exactly half of these arrangements are
soluble, and the other half insoluble. The
whole question turns upon the fact that in
the arrangement of a certain number of
figures in a row, otherwise than in consecutive
order, the arrangement is made
up either by an odd or an even number of
transpositions. In the total number of
different rows in which any given number
of figures can be arranged, half of them
will consist of rows containing an odd
number, and the other half an even number
of transpositions, just in the same way
that in the numbers one to one hundred
there are fifty odd and fifty even numbers.
Take the case of six figures, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6. If the first pair of figures is transposed
the row will read 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6.
In this row there is an odd number,
namely, 1, of transpositions. If from this
order the second pair is transposed the
result will read 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 6, and in this
row there is an even number (2) of transpositions
made from the original consecutive
order. Suppose the last pair is
transposed, the order will be 2, 1, 4, 3,
6, 5, and an odd number (3) of transpositions
has been made. This may be continued
until all the different rows possible
have been worked, when it is evident that
the first, third, fifth, etc., rows will each
consist of an odd number of transpositions,
while the intermediate rows will each contain
an even number of transpositions.</p>

<p>Suppose we take the third row given
above, 2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, this contains an odd
number of transpositions. It is therefore
impossible, by making an <i>even number</i> of
transpositions each time, to bring 2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5
to the original position of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
because it contains an odd number of
transpositions, one of which will always
remain, and cannot be eliminated by any
even number of transpositions. Just in
the same way we cannot, by the addition
of even numbers, to any quantity or
amount, to an odd number, produce an
even number as the result. Every arrangement
of a certain number of figures in a
row contains therefore an odd or even
number of transpositions which must be
made before the figures can be brought
into consecutive order, but it is immaterial
whether these transpositions are made in
such order as will the soonest produce the
consecutive order, so long as they are
made, and the number, whether odd or
even, is noted.</p>

<p>By writing down a row of fifteen figures,
and transposing two numbers each time,
and noting whether an odd or even number
of transpositions are required to produce
the consecutive order, it can be
ascertained whether the cubes, in this
order, can or cannot be moved into the
consecutive order. If the required number
of transpositions <i>is an odd number it
will be impossible</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.&mdash;SOME MINOR GAMES.</h3>

<h4 class="fsize80">I.&mdash;A NEW INDOOR GAME.</h4>

<p class="noindent">This is a good indoor game for boys,
which I believe has not yet appeared in
any form in England. It is a modification
of one played by the students in Germany,
but adapted to English words, and
with a special arrangement of the figures,
which the original game does not admit of,
the words not being so suitable.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXIX01">
<img src="images/illo214.png" alt="new game" width="350" height="370" />
</div>

<p>The above <a href="#FigXIX01">diagram</a> is chalked on the
floor, the figures being about one foot
across and one foot apart. Then one
player takes his place on the middle
figure, facing Fig. 6. The other players
then sing the old rhyme of the &#8216;Crooked
Man&#8217; to the &#8216;King Pippin Polka,&#8217; known
also as &#8216;My mother said,&#8217; etc.</p>

<p>Then the player, with his feet together,
jumps to No. 1, No. 2, etc., as the words
&#8216;man,&#8217; &#8216;mile,&#8217; etc., are mentioned. He
must not turn round, or put his feet outside
the figures. The others keep time
by clapping with their hands. If the
player jumps to a wrong figure, or to one
before it is sung, he pays a forfeit, especially
for the last line.</p>

<p>The verse is then repeated to the second
part of the tune, the player jumping to each
figure <i>before</i> it is mentioned, and giving a
second jump on it, before going to the
next. The last line finishes off with a
wild repetition of the figure, the player
stepping from one figure to the next as
fast as he can, finishing on No. 7 to the
last word. The player must place both
feet on Fig. 7 to the words &#8216;and they,&#8217;
then the right on Fig. 1, and so on, to the
last one. The great difficulty in the last
line is to get the left foot from Fig. 4 to
Fig. 6 in time. This is done by passing
the right foot <i>behind</i> the left, when moving
it from Fig. 3 to Fig. 5, which will enable
the player to finish without tying his legs
in a knot. The words and the numbers of
the figures for the player to jump to are
here given (commencing on No. 7 and
facing Fig. 6)&mdash;</p>

<ol class="newgame">

<h4><span class="fsize80">II.&mdash;KNUCKLE BONES.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">By Captain A. S. Harrison.</span></h4>

<p>The game is played with five bones,
and the stages are as follows<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Beginnings.</i>&mdash;The five bones are
gathered in the palm of the hand and
thrown up, any number being caught on
the back of the hand; they are then
tossed up again, and caught in the palm.
One is selected, thrown into the air, and
one at a time the remainder picked up,
while the one thrown is in the air. This
must be caught and again thrown for the
next bone. The bone thrown up is called
the &#8216;dab,&#8217; and must be caught <i>clear</i>, without
touching any part of the person but
the right hand under all circumstances of
the game.</p>

<p>2. <i>Ones.</i>&mdash;The five bones are thrown on
to the table, and the dab selected is thrown
up, and the remainder are taken up, one
by one, without touching any other bone.</p>

<p>3. <i>Twos.</i>&mdash;The same again, but two
taken up for each throw of the dab.</p>

<p>4. <i>Threes.</i>&mdash;Three picked up, and then
one.</p>

<p>5. <i>Fours.</i>&mdash;Four picked up.</p>

<p class="kbones">In twos, threes, and fours, it is permitted
by consent of the adversary to push
the selected bones together while the dab
is in the air. The touching of any other
than the selected bones, or the failure to
pick up the proper number, forfeits the
turn.</p>

<p>6. <i>Short Spans.</i>&mdash;Two bones are placed
on the table, each side of the left hand,
one pair close to the thumb, the other
pair at the tip of the little finger. Each
pair must be taken up separately, without
any pushing together.</p>

<p>7. <i>Long Spans.</i>&mdash;A bone is placed at
the extremities of the thumb and little
finger, stretched out to the widest.
Another pair is put in the same way
about six inches farther on the table.
These pairs must be taken up without any
touching together: any bone displaced
may be put back again <i>three</i> times; failure
on the third trial forfeits the turn.</p>

<p>8. <i>Creek Mouse.</i>&mdash;The five bones are
tossed from the palm, and any number
caught on the back of the hand; all but
one are shaken off; the remainder are
then gathered into the palm, without disturbing
the one on the back, which is then
tossed and caught in the palm, with the
others.</p>

<p>9. <i>Second Creek Mouse.</i>&mdash;The five bones
are tossed from the palm as before, and
one is retained on the back. The remainder
are taken one between each
finger and thumb, the one on the back is
then tossed and caught in the extended
palm.</p>

<p>10. <i>Bridges.</i>&mdash;The hand is laid on the
back on the table, the bones held between
the fingers are then dropped in a row on
the table. An arch is formed with the
first finger and thumb of the left hand at
about six inches from the left-hand bone
of the four. They are then one by one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
pushed through this bridge; when all are
through the left hand is removed, and the
four are taken up at one sweep. No
touching together is allowed.</p>

<p>11. <i>Cracks.</i>&mdash;The bones are thrown on
the table, and the four picked up one by
one; the dab in falling and being caught to
make a <i>distinct crack</i> on the one picked up.</p>

<p>12. <i>No Cracks.</i>&mdash;Same as before, but
the dab must be caught without touching
the other bone. The slightest sound forfeits
the turn.</p>

<p>13. <i>Exchanges.</i>&mdash;The four bones are
laid at the corners of a square, a full span
on each side. The first bone is picked up
from the lower right-hand corner, and at
the next throw is exchanged for the one
above. This is exchanged for the one at
the top left-hand corner, this for the lower
left, and that is placed at the point of
starting. The bones are then taken up in
diagonal pairs.</p>

<p>14. <i>Everlastings.</i>&mdash;The whole of the
bones are tossed from the palms, and any
number caught on the back. These are
tossed from the back and caught in the
palm; and any that have fallen in the first
toss have to be picked up while the whole
of the others are in the air, so that at one
moment there may be four dabs and one
to pick up. This task, as the name implies,
approaches the everlasting.</p>

<p>The game is an excellent one for exercising
and developing that perfect sympathy
between the eye and the hand which
is certain to be of great service in after life.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.&mdash;THE MAGIC-LANTERN, AND ALL ABOUT IT.</h3>

<h4>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pleasant Hours with the Magic-Lantern.&mdash;By A. A. Wood, F.C.S.</span></h4>

<h5 class="fsize80">1.&mdash;ALL ABOUT LANTERNS.</h5>

<p class="noindent">The magic-lantern is of very respectable antiquity. As early as the seventeenth
century a Jesuit, named Kircher, had constructed one. He was not unwilling to
excite the fears of the persons who witnessed the effects of his apparatus, and not
only did he apply the word <i>magic</i> to his lantern, but when exhibiting it he had the
darkened room divided into two compartments, in one of which was the lantern,
and in the other the spectators. These gazed on the shadowy forms before them
in amazement, and were unable to perceive how they were produced.</p>

<p>Kircher&#8217;s lantern consisted of a large wooden box, with a door on one side and
an opening in front for the reception of a tube containing a magnifying lens. The
light was obtained by means of an oil lamp with a polished brass reflector, the
smoke of the lamp being conveyed away by a chimney in the top. The pictures
exhibited were painted on long strips of glass, and were passed through a groove in
the front tube, and although the effects thus obtained must have been of the most
imperfect character, yet from their novelty they produced a most profound
impression.</p>

<p>There are reasons to believe that the lantern was in use even earlier than the
seventeenth century, and that the mysterious figures which the old astrologers produced
in the smoke of their mystic fires were produced in the same way as Kircher&#8217;s,
the smoke forming the screen. With this brief description of the history of the
magic-lantern, we must be content. Our main business is to describe the construction
and use of the lantern as manufactured now.</p>

<p>The magic-lantern, as now constructed, consists of a box or chamber of
japanned tin-plate, with a lamp for the source of light, a large lens to converge
the light, and a smaller lens to magnify the object to be exhibited. The large lens
is called the <i>condenser</i>, and the smaller lens is designated the <i>objective</i>. Between the
<i>condenser</i> and the <i>objective</i>, immediately in front of the former, an aperture is
provided for the reception of the painted slide. This aperture is called the slide-holder.
We may separate magic-lanterns into three great divisions, the distinguishing
difference between them being the kind of light employed. In the first division
the lamps are constructed to burn colza or sperm oil; in the second division a
mineral oil (purified paraffin) takes the place of the sperm or colza oil; and in the
third division some form of lime-light is employed. We will describe these varieties
in order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>First, then, let us deal with the lanterns illuminated by a lamp burning colza or
sperm oil. Of these lanterns there are two subdivisions, those whose condensing
lenses are of a size suitable for exhibiting the standard slides (slides three and a
quarter inches in diameter), called phantasmagoria lanterns,
and lanterns of a smaller size, which may be
described as toys, and for which but a very limited
variety of slides can be obtained. We give an illustration
(<a href="#FigXX01a">Fig. 1</a>) of one of these small lanterns, from which it will
be seen that the lamp is of very simple construction,
and provided with a silvered reflector behind it. Magic-lanterns,
the condensing lenses of which are from one and
a half inch to two and a half inches in diameter, are calculated
to produce discs of light from four feet to six feet
in diameter. Such discs are usually obtained when the
distance of the lantern from the screen is about one-third
more than the desired diameter of the disc. Lanterns
such as these are described, according to their size, by
number, and include all from Nos. 1 to 6.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX01a">
<img src="images/illo220.jpg" alt="magic lantern" width="300" height="348" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>In preparing this lantern for use the lenses should be carefully cleaned with a
soft cloth, and the lamp freshly trimmed. The cotton must be long enough to
reach to the bottom of the lamp, and be freshly and evenly cut; the oil should be
supplied to the lamp an hour before it is lighted, that the wick may become
thoroughly saturated. The best oil to use is sperm oil in which camphor has been
dissolved in the proportion of one ounce to one pint of oil. The object of the
addition of the camphor is to increase the brilliancy of the light. If, however,
sperm oil cannot be obtained, colza oil may be substituted, and this should be
treated with camphor in the same way.</p>

<p>The room in which the exhibition is to take place should be entirely darkened,
and a clean white screen or sheet hung up for the reception of the magnified
pictures. The lantern is to be placed in front of the screen, upon a table or other
suitable support, and at such a distance as will produce the required disc or circle
of light.</p>

<p>The painted slide must be placed in the slide-holder upside down, and if the
representation on the screen be not clear and sharp, the objective (the front lens)
must be moved towards or away from the slide-holder, until the picture is well
defined, or, as it is called, properly focused.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">3.&mdash;THE PHANTASMAGORIA LANTERN.</h5>

<p>We have given a description of the simpler forms of the magic-lantern burning
sperm or colza oil with a solid wick, and now we will explain the construction of that
known as the phantasmagoria lantern. The term &#8216;phantasmagoria&#8217; was originally
applied to a lantern exhibition, in which the figures on the screen varied suddenly in
their dimensions, seeming at one time as though they were rushing on to the
spectators, and at another vanishing away in the distance. At present this name is
used as the distinctive title of a particular form of magic-lantern, otherwise known as
the &#8216;No. 8.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>In the phantasmagoria lantern the condenser consists of two lenses (usually
a meniscus convex and a double convex) fitted into a brass cell and placed in the
lantern with the concave side towards the lamp. The objective is also formed of
two lenses fitted into a brass tube with a diaphragm in front. This tube slides into
a brass jacket fixed in front of the lantern, and the lenses are placed in the tube
with their convex sides towards the condenser.</p>

<div class="figc285">

<div class="figleft" id="FigXX02a">

<img src="images/illo221b.jpg" alt="magic lantern" width="85" height="368" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>The lamp employed for illuminating the phantasmagoria lantern is the Argand
fountain lamp, with hollow cylindrical wick (<a href="#FigXX02a">Fig. 2</a>). In preparing this lamp for
use, a new cotton should be fitted to it. To do this with facility the cotton should
be put on to a taper-stick (<a href="#FigXX03a">Fig. 3</a>), on to the base of which the brass wick-holder fits,
the cotton can then be pushed on to the wick-holder without any difficulty. The
wick-holder and wick are to be replaced in the lamp and
screwed down to the bottom, and if there be any superfluous
wick standing above the top of the lamp it is to be ignited
and allowed to <i>burn itself out</i>. (This must be done before
any oil is supplied to the lamp.) The wick being ready, the
cistern at the back of the lamp is to be lifted out and inverted,
and then filled with oil. The plug or valve which serves to
close the orifice in the cistern through which the oil has been
poured is to be pulled up and so held while the cistern is replaced
in the lamp. The oil should be supplied to the lamp
about half an hour before it is required for use, in order that
the wick may be thoroughly saturated, and camphorated sperm
oil is decidedly the best oil to be used in this lamp. When
the lamp is first lighted the wick should be raised but a short distance above the
tube that supports it, and after it is ignited all round, the lamp should be replaced in
the lantern, the glass chimney (which is screwed on to a metal oxydator and gallery)
placed on it, and the wick turned up as high as it will admit of <i>without smoking</i>.
The lantern is then to be placed on the stand or table in front of the screen, at a
distance of from nine to twelve feet off, a disc of six feet in diameter being obtained
at the former distance, and eight feet diameter at the latter. After the lamp has been
placed in the sliding tray provided for it at the bottom of the lantern, its position
has to be adjusted. If the lamp be too near to the condenser, the centre of the disc
will be darkened; if too far off, the margin of the disc will be obscured; the proper
distance will be easily ascertained when the lamp is lighted and placed in the lantern.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">4.&mdash;THE EUPHANERON LANTERN.</h5>

<p>The phantasmagoria lantern continued for some years to maintain its character
as the best lamp-lit lantern ever made. And this might have still continued, but for
the discovery that the art of photography could produce transparent slides suitable
for the magic-lantern.</p>

<p>The necessity for a superior illuminating arrangement was at once experienced,
and attention was given to the lamps that were fed with the mineral oils, instead of
animal or vegetable oils. Although various forms of mineral oil lamps were tried,
they were not successful, until Mr. L. Marcy, of Philadelphia, conceived the
idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of constructing a lantern sufficiently small to make one chamber serve as the lantern
and the lamp. He used for his wick two flat cottons parallel to one another, with
the tops almost in contact, and the edges of the wicks turned towards the condenser.
This lamp he charged with mineral oil, and thus obtained an instrument surpassing
anything of the kind previously constructed.</p>

<p>Since then many improvements have been made, each modification receiving a
distinctive title. We have thus &#8216;The Silber Light,&#8217; &#8216;The Triplexicon,&#8217; &#8216;The
Duplexicon,&#8217; &#8216;The Refulgent,&#8217; &#8216;The Euphaneron.&#8217; It will not be necessary to
explain each of them in detail, as they have many things in common, and it will
suffice to describe &#8216;The Euphaneron,&#8217; which is perhaps the best of the series.</p>

<p>The Euphaneron (that which shows well) differs in several important particulars
from the phantasmagoria lantern. The body of the lantern (which serves to support
the condenser and objective) is made of Russian plate iron, which neither rusts nor
blisters. The condenser consists of two 4-in. lenses of the form we have already
described, and the objective is a double achromatic combination. The outer lens
of the objective, designated the &#8216;front lens,&#8217; is in form a plano-convex lens. The
inner lens, called the &#8216;back lens,&#8217; consists of two separate lenses, one an unequi-convex
lens, the other a meniscus-concave lens. This combination gives a
beautifully-defined picture on the screen, with flatness of field and abundance of light.</p>

<p>The lamp is entirely distinct from the body, and will burn equally well either
outside or inside the body of the lantern, the chimney being attached to the lamp
and not to the body. The cistern of the lamp forms its base, and is filled with
mineral oil. From the top of the cistern rise two rectangular tubes, sloping together
as they rise; these contain the two wicks. The wicks do not stand parallel to each
other, but form an acute angle with the base of the triangle towards the condenser,
and this is the peculiarity that brings about the equal illumination of the disc. The
wicks are raised and depressed by the action of two milled heads at the back of the
lamp. Now, instead of surrounding the flames with a glass chimney, as is ordinarily
the case, a metal combustion chamber is provided, and to this chamber the chimney
is attached. The ends of the chamber are open, the front being closed by a glass
plate, the back by a silvered reflector. Attempts have recently been made to add a
third wick to this lamp, but they have not been very successful, the lantern being
rendered very much hotter without affording a corresponding gain in brilliancy.
The Euphaneron exhibits photographic slides in a most satisfactory manner on a
disc 10 ft. in diameter. The disc is uniformly illuminated, and the picture well in
focus all over the screen.</p>

<p><i>Directions for trimming the Euphaneron Lamp.</i>&mdash;Remove the lamp from the
lantern, carefully clean the front glass and the mirror. Turn back the combustion-chamber
on its hinge, so as to expose the tops of the wicks. These should be cut
quite smooth and straight, without any projecting filaments. The cistern should be
nearly filled with the best mineral oil, and the wicks turned up a little way and lit.
The combustion chamber should be now restored to its place, the lamp put into the
lantern, and the chimney fixed on. The wicks should then be gradually raised as
high as they will bear without smoking. In putting the oil into the lamp care
should be taken not to spill any on the outside. The general directions already
given for showing the pictures are then to be followed in using the Euphaneron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<h5 class="fsize80">5.&mdash;DISSOLVING VIEWS.</h5>

<p>The lanterns that we have hitherto been describing have been those capable
of exhibiting single pictures only; we have now to explain the production of
dissolving views.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX04a">
<img src="images/illo223.jpg" alt="magic lantern" width="350" height="459" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.</p>
</div>

<p>Dissolving views, as the name implies, is an exhibition of pictures in which
there is a fading away of one and the appearance of another, as though the one
picture grew out of the wreck of the other. To
produce these results, two lanterns of similar size
are required (see <a href="#FigXX04a">Fig. 4</a>), together with some
contrivance for diminishing the light forming the
first picture, until that has quite faded away, simultaneously
allowing that forming the second picture
to fall upon the screen until this one has arrived
at its complete intensity, and the first picture is
no longer seen. This latter contrivance is known
as the mechanical dissolver, and it consists of two
serrated plates attached to a movable bar fixed
to the front edge of the base upon which the
lanterns are supported. These plates come immediately
in front of the lanterns, and require to be
so arranged that when the whole of the light from
one lantern is seen on the screen, the light from
the other is entirely stopped. By means of a
rack and pinion motion, the plates can be moved
simultaneously, and each lantern alternately closed
and opened.</p>

<p>In order to make the discs of light produced by the two lanterns coincident,
the lanterns must be slightly inclined towards each other.</p>

<p>There is another class of results obtained by the dissolving-views apparatus,
which may be designated as the production of &#8216;composite&#8217; pictures or &#8216;effects,&#8217;
as, for instance, a soldier is seen asleep by the watch-fire, he dreams, and the
subjects of his dream appear, one after the other, on the screen, and then fade
away. A ship is seen at sea; day turns into night; the moon rises; a violent
storm comes on; the lightning flashes, and the ship is set on fire. A water-mill
is shown with the stream running and the wheel revolving; a swan appears on the
water and moves across the stream; night comes on, the wheel ceases to revolve,
and the windows of the house are lit up; clouds flit across the sky; the moon
rises&mdash;day returns, but the scene has changed to winter; the water is frozen, and
its surface occupied by skaters, and a fall of snow takes place.</p>

<p>To produce such effects as these, both lanterns are required to be open at the
same time, and the serrated plates forming the dissolver must be so contrived
that the one which would otherwise obscure the fixed picture is turned aside, or
removed altogether, and therefore only <i>one</i> lantern is alternately opened and
closed. The foundation picture (the sleeping soldier, for example) is placed
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the lantern that remains constantly open, and to this the addition (the dream) are
made with the second lantern.</p>

<p>For dissolving views proper, only two lanterns are required, and for the simpler
form of effects two lanterns suffice; but for very complex pictures, three, four, or
even five lanterns are required. Any two lanterns of equal size and power may
be employed to produce dissolving views; but the phantasmagoria lantern is the
smallest that can be advantageously used.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">6.&mdash;THE LIME-LIGHT.</h5>

<p>We have described the typical oil-lit lanterns, and now we shall explain the production
of the lime-light in its two principal modifications of the &#8216;oxycalcium&#8217; and
the &#8216;oxyhydrogen&#8217; light. The lime-light is obtained by intensely heating a piece of
lime, in which condition it emits a most brilliant light. The lime is generally used
in the form of a cylinder seven-eighths of an inch diameter and one and a quarter
inch long, having a hole along its centre from end to end; these cylinders are sold
in tin boxes, each containing twelve.</p>

<p>When a box containing lime cylinders has been
opened, it is best to transfer the cylinders to a wide-mouth
stoppered bottle, and keep the same in a dry
place, as moisture causes the lime to crumble to dust.
As the lime is only required to furnish some solid
material capable of being rendered incandescent, many
other substances can be used for this purpose&mdash;the
best substitute, if lime cannot be obtained, being chalk.</p>

<p>The oxycalcium light requires for its production a large loose flame, a
jet of oxygen gas, and a cylinder of lime. The two instruments now to be
described&mdash;one known as the oxycalcium <i>jet</i> and the other as the oxycalcium
<i>lamp</i>&mdash;fully realise these conditions, and although accomplishing the purpose
in somewhat different ways, each form of instrument possesses some special
advantage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX05a">
<img src="images/illo224.jpg" alt="magic lantern" width="450" height="210" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 5.</p>
</div>

<p>The oxycalcium lamp is represented at <a href="#FigXX05a">Fig. 5</a>, and it consists of a vessel with
an aperture in its base, is provided with a valve to close the same when needed,
and is capable of holding about a half-pint of spirits of wine. This is called the
cistern, and it is placed valve downwards into a second or outer cylinder rather
deeper than itself. This operation opens the valve of the cistern, and allows a
sufficiency of spirit to flow out so as to fill the space between the bottom of the
cistern and the bottom of the outer cylinder. From this outer cylinder proceeds
a long horizontal tube, terminating in a small chamber that holds the wick, and
it is here that the lamp is lighted.</p>

<p>Behind the wick is a steel pin for holding the cylinder of lime, and in front
of the wick is the small end of a bent tube (marked <i>o o</i>), carrying the oxygen gas.
This oxygen gas tube passes along the under side of the tube connecting the outer
cylinder with the wick chamber, and extending some little distance behind
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
outer cylinder, there terminates in a tap. This tap is to be connected with the bag
containing the oxygen gas by means of a flexible pipe.</p>

<p>In arranging the oxycalcium lamp for use the cistern should be filled with spirits
of wine, and the wick cut off smooth. The lime cylinder is to be placed on the
support, and the tap <i>o</i> connected with the bag containing the oxygen gas.</p>

<p>A weight equal to about 40 lb. or 50 lb. is to be placed on the bag, and the
apparatus is ready for use. The lamp is to be lighted at the wick and the gas
admitted by gradually turning the tap at the end of the tube <i>o</i>; the tap attached
to the <i>bag</i> having been previously turned fully on. The oxygen gas now issues
from the point of the tube in front of the flame and forces the flame against the
lime, producing thus the oxycalcium light.</p>

<p>The quantity of gas admitted requires to be regulated to the size of the lamp
flame, for if the gas be in excess, the lime will be cooled down and the light
diminished. A similar loss of light will result from having too little gas; so that
some attention will be required to enable the operator to adjust the apparatus
satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The wick should be carefully put into the wick-holder in straight lengths, not
twisted together, and not too tightly packed. A slight separation should be made
in the top of the wick to allow the stream of gas to pass freely. The point of the
jet should be about one-tenth of an inch below the top of the wick, and should not
project into the wick. The wick should be kept up close to the point of the <i>jet</i>, and
not be allowed to bend towards the <i>lime cylinder</i>.</p>

<p>The spirit to be used with the oxycalcium lamp
is to be alcohol or the best methylated spirit;
paraffin spirit will not do. It is best to renew
the wick each time the lamp is used.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX06a">
<img src="images/illo225.jpg" alt="magic lantern" width="450" height="130" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 6.</p>
</div>

<p>It is now necessary to describe the other
form of oxycalcium light&mdash;the oxycalcium <i>jet</i>.</p>

<p>The oxycalcium jet is shown at <a href="#FigXX06a">Fig. 6</a>, and it will be seen that the cistern and
wick-holder required by the oxycalcium lamp are both dispensed with. There are,
instead, two horizontal tubes lying side by side, each having a stopcock at one end,
the other end of each tube being turned up, one&mdash;the hydrogen tube&mdash;at right
angles and inserted into the stem of a sort of oblique T-shaped tube. The end of
the other horizontal tube&mdash;the oxygen tube&mdash;is bent into a bow form, so that it may
pass through the crosspiece of the oblique T-shaped tube before mentioned. The
stopcock of the oxygen tube is to be connected with the bag containing the oxygen
gas, and the stopcock of the hydrogen tube is to be attached by a flexible tube to
any of the gas-fittings in the room where the apparatus is to be used. By this
arrangement a stream of ordinary hydrogen or street gas will pass through the
hydrogen tube into the oblique T-shaped tube, and will issue out at its open end,
where it is to be lighted. This flame, by the action of the stream of oxygen issuing
from the end of the oxygen tube, will be forced against the lime cylinder, and
produce, as in the former case, the oxycalcium light. The same attention to the
adjustment of the quantity of oxygen gas to the size of the hydrogen flame that was
necessary for the oxycalcium lamp is equally needed with the oxycalcium jet, and
by means of the two taps this can be managed with the greatest facility. It is
usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
to drill a hole through the flat part of the key of the oxygen stopcock, so that it may
be readily distinguished. It sometimes occurs that the gas-fittings from whence the
supply of hydrogen is to be obtained have immovable nipples. In this case it will
be found advantageous to connect, by means of a T-piece, two or even more of the
nipples with the tube that is to convey the hydrogen to the jet; closing, of course,
those that are not thus used.</p>

<p>It is obvious that in using the oxycalcium jet the operator is dependent for his
flame upon a supply of the ordinary hydrogen or street gas, and therefore this
modification of the oxycalcium apparatus cannot be employed in any place unprovided
with the means of obtaining the same. The oxycalcium lamp, on the other
hand, as it carries with it the means of producing the required flame, can be used
anywhere. The light obtained by the oxycalcium arrangement, although not equal
to the oxyhydrogen light, is admirably adapted for exhibitions on a moderate scale,
and it requires only one gas-bag.</p>

<p>In both of the oxycalcium arrangements the lime cylinder does not need any
alteration of position while in use. The proper distance between the oxygen jet
and the surface of the lime varies from one-eighth of an inch to one-quarter of an
inch.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">7.&mdash;OXYHYDROGEN JET.</h5>

<p>Having explained the oxycalcium lamp and jet, we have now to describe the
oxyhydrogen jet, by which the brightest form of lime-light is produced. The oxyhydrogen
jet differs from those previously described in one important particular, viz.
that the two gases are mingled together as gases
before being ignited. Like the oxycalcium jet, it
consists of two tubes lying side by side (see <a href="#FigXX07a">Fig. 7</a>),
having a tap at one end of each. The ends of
these tubes are inserted into the base of a small
chamber, from which proceeds a single curved
tube, which rises up in front of the holder upon
which the lime cylinder is placed. The end of this tube is contracted by a
platinum point screwed into it, and this forms the jet. Two bags are required
for this light, one containing hydrogen gas (common house gas will do), and the
other bag filled with oxygen gas, and these bags are to be connected with the taps
at the end of the jet by means of flexible tubes in the usual manner. The two gases
are thus kept separate until they enter the chamber at the base of the curved pipe.
This chamber is provided with layers of wire gauze, so as to facilitate the admixture
of the gases, which eventually issue thoroughly mingled from the point of the jet.
In this condition they are capable of being ignited, and as soon as the flame
impinges on the lime cylinder a most intense light results.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX07a">
<img src="images/illo226.jpg" alt="magic lantern" width="450" height="173" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.</p>
</div>

<p>The lime-holder of the oxyhydrogen jet is made to slide, so as to be capable of
being moved towards or away from the point of the jet. This adjustment is necessary
to rectify any slight difference in the diameter of the lime cylinders, for, in order to
obtain the full amount of light, the face of the lime cylinder requires to be brought
as close to the point of the jet as it can be without being in contact with it. In
addition to this movement, the stem on which the lime cylinder is supported is also
made to revolve, in order to provide a fresh surface of lime to be presented to
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
action of the flame. The heating power of the flame of the oxyhydrogen gases is
so intense that a cavity is soon burnt in the face of the lime cylinder, and if this
part of the cylinder were to be allowed to continue opposite to the jet, the light
would be greatly diminished and the general effect marred. To provide against this,
the stem of the lime-holder is made with a screw at its lower end, this screw working
in a corresponding socket, so that by turning the stem of the lime-holder round on
its axis a second motion in a perpendicular direction is also given to it. By this
means the face of the lime passes before the point of the jet in a spiral direction,
and consequently the same part of the lime cylinder is not brought a second time
under the action of the flame. In order to facilitate the rotation of the lime
cylinder, the screw is sometimes set in motion by clockwork; but the better plan is
to turn the lime by means of a horizontal rod with bevel wheels.</p>

<p>Having described the various forms of apparatus constructed for producing the
lime-light by means of oxygen and hydrogen gases, a few general observations will
not be out of place. It should be borne in mind that oxygen gas is a supporter of
combustion, and is neither explosive nor inflammable. The hydrogen gas will
ignite, but will only do so in the presence of oxygen. With the oxycalcium lamp
and oxycalcium jet, there is complete safety from explosion. In the oxyhydrogen
jet there is also complete safety if care is taken not to fill up the hydrogen-bag with
oxygen, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Such an admixture is explosive, and nothing can prevent
an explosion when a light is applied. The contents of one bag will not pass into
the other during an exhibition, and even if the weights were to fall off the bags, the
only effect would be to put the light out.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">8.&mdash;THE GAS AND GAS-BAGS.</h5>

<p>Several times in describing the production of the lime-light reference has been
made to gas-bags; and now we will explain more fully what they are. Gas-bags
are usually made of stout india-rubber cloth, wedge-shaped,
their length being half as much again as
their width, and the base usually equal to their
width. A tap is provided and attached to the
apex of the bag, so as to allow of the admission
and expulsion of the gas. In order to press out
the gas from a filled bag, two boards are used.
These boards are of similar dimensions to the
bag, and being hinged together along one edge,
can be separated to allow of the introduction of
the inflated gas-bag. A projecting ledge is fixed
on the outside of the upper board, about eight
inches from its end, against which the weight
required to press out the gas can rest. The
weights should be square-shaped, and the most
convenient size is a half-hundredweight. When
two bags are required (as in the case of the oxyhydrogen light), the double
pressure-board (<a href="#FigXX08a">Fig. 8</a>) should be employed; the two bags are then placed one
above the other, and one set of weights only is required instead of two sets.
The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
weight required to be used with a bag of eight feet capacity when employed for the
oxycalcium lamp or jet should be about 56 lbs., but at least three times that amount
should be placed on the bags for the production of the oxyhydrogen light.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX08a">
<img src="images/illo227.jpg" alt="magic lantern" width="350" height="348" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 8.</p>
</div>

<p>It is not desirable to keep either oxygen or hydrogen gas in india-rubber bags
for any length of time. Oxygen can be kept for a few days or a week, but any
hydrogen gas that may remain in the bag after an exhibition should be expelled
before the bag is refilled. When two bags are in use, each should be marked; <b><span class="lgsymb">O</span></b>
on the oxygen bag, and <b><span class="lgsymb">H</span></b> on the hydrogen bag; and the bags should not be used
interchangeably; <i>i.e.</i>, hydrogen gas should not be put into an oxygen bag, nor
oxygen into the hydrogen bag. In arranging the apparatus, place the pressure
boards and bags where they will not be meddled with. Let the weights be securely
placed on the pressure boards, so that they may not slide or roll off during the
exhibition. Do not on any account allow any one to stand upon or press the
boards with his foot as a substitute for, or in addition to, the weights. The lime
cylinder should be wiped clean from dust before it is put upon the holder, and it
should be exposed to the flame of the lamp or simple hydrogen flame some minutes
before the oxygen is turned on, so that it may not fracture when the light is being
produced. When all arrangements are complete, the hydrogen should be turned on
and lighted, and oxygen should be gradually turned on until the requisite degree of
light is obtained. With the oxycalcium light some exhibitors use the compressed
oxygen, the gas being compressed into an iron cylinder, and thus bags,
boards, and weights are not needed. This arrangement has the advantage of
portability, but the cylinders have to be filled by means of a steam pump&mdash;a thing
not always to be obtained. When a cylinder is used it should be placed as close
to the jet as possible, and the flow of gas must be regulated by the valve of the
cylinder, and not by the tap of the jet.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">9.&mdash;OXYGEN AND HYDROGEN.</h5>

<p>The two gases, oxygen and hydrogen, required for the production of the lime-light
need now some separate notice, as it often occurs that those who use these
gases for dissolving-view exhibitions have to prepare the one&mdash;sometimes both&mdash;for
themselves.</p>

<p>Oxygen gas is a simple elementary body, and is most extensively diffused
throughout our earth. It is one of the constituents of the atmosphere surrounding
our globe, and also of water, as well as of nearly all the substances known as acids.
It has never yet been met in its separate or uncombined state, and therefore it can
only be obtained by decomposing some substance of which it is a constituent.</p>

<p>The material most convenient for obtaining oxygen gas for lime-light purposes is
chlorate of potassa. Two parts of this material (by weight) is mixed with one part
of powered black oxide of manganese (this is known as &#8216;oxygen mixture&#8217;). The
oxide of manganese does not supply any of the oxygen, but its presence facilitates
the decomposition of the chlorate of potassa. The apparatus used for generating
the gas is shown at <a href="#FigXX09a">Fig. 9</a>. It consists of a copper or iron vessel (A), forming the
retort or generator, a glass bottle-shaped vessel (B), which is the purifier, the two
being connected together by a flexible tube. It will be seen that there are two
tubes proceeding from the top of the purifier, one of which reaches nearly to
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
bottom of the vessel, and the other only just enters into the top. The former, or
long tube, is the tube by which the purifier is attached to the retort; the latter, or
short tube, is that which connects the purifier with the bag.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX09a">
<img src="images/illo229.jpg" alt="magic lantern" width="350" height="224" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 9.</p>
</div>

<p>The method of charging the apparatus is as follows. Put into the retort about
a pound and a half of oxygen mixture; pour into the
purifier a sufficient quantity of water to about two-thirds
fill it. Place the retort on a clear but not fierce fire, or
over a gas furnace, and unite it to the <i>long</i> tube of the
purifier (B). Attach the <i>short</i> pipe from the purifier to
the gas-bag, and open all the taps, so that there may be
a free passage-way from the retort to the bag. In a few
minutes the gas will be given off, and will manifest itself
by rising in bubbles through the water in the purifier.
If a fierce fire be employed, the gas will be given off with
undue rapidity and will pass through the purifier in volumes, so that it only becomes
partially washed. A rapid but regular succession of gas is most to be desired. Should
the gas come off with great violence, the retort should be lifted from the fire without
disarranging the apparatus, and when the excessive rapidity is moderated it can be
replaced. It is not, however, desirable to remove the retort from the fire if it can
be avoided, for it not unfrequently happens that when the retort cools down,
with only partially decomposed material in it, waste is the consequence, as it is not
quite easy to re-establish the decomposing process. When the gas has entirely
come off&mdash;which may be known by the cessation of the bubbles in the purifier&mdash;the
top of the bag should be closed, the retort taken from the fire, detached from
the purifier, and stood aside to cool. When cold, the residuum may be readily
washed out with water, and when dry, the retort is ready for use again. The purifier
should be emptied and washed out also. Always blow through the flexible tubes
leading from the retort to the purifier, and wash out the metal tube of the retort
in order to remove any solid material that may have been deposited there from
the gas.</p>

<p>There has recently been manufactured a very neat oxygen gas-generator and
gas-burner combined. The inventor proposes to prepare the oxygen in the room
where the exhibition is taking place, and while using the lanterns. But as this
apparatus would be very difficult to manipulate with, even by an experienced
operator, it cannot be recommended for general use.</p>

<p>With regard to the hydrogen gas, it is always best to use the ordinary house gas,
or if that cannot be obtained, to use the oxycalcium lamp, as the preparation of the
pure hydrogen gas is troublesome, and not quite free from danger.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80">10.&mdash;SLIDE PAINTING, ETC.</h5>

<p>The preparation of magic-lantern slides for home use (although, perhaps, not
equalling the bought ones in quality) is a great source of pleasure, and a few hints
on this part of our subject will probably be acceptable. A number of very amusing
slides may be made by cutting grotesque or other figures out of black paper, and
pasting them on glass slips, and after the pictures are dry, giving a little detail by
slashing the picture with a sharp penknife in places where needed. If these
figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
be first drawn on tissue paper, coloured, and then cut out, the effect is still more
pleasing. Or, if preferred, sheets of these figures in black can be bought, and thus
the trouble of drawing them will be saved.</p>

<p>A very efficient set of astronomical slides may be constructed out of blackened
cardboard with the aid of a few punches, some different-sized needles, and some of
the coloured gelatine bon-bons. Having cut the card of a size suitable for the
lantern, and marked on it a circle of the same diameter as the lantern condenser,
prick holes in the card by aid of the needles, so as to represent the principal constellations
and nebul&aelig;, illustrations of which will be found in most works on
astronomy. The relative positions of the planets may be shown by punching holes
in the cardboard and covering them over with gelatine. When the holes are
punched, the orbits may be traced by a very minute row of holes, pricked with a
fine needle, the circles having first been marked with a pair of compasses.</p>

<p>For larger diagrams representing the planets singly, a sharp penknife and a pair
of compasses would, combined with a steady hand, produce wonders.</p>

<p>The painting of magic-lantern slides on glass is a rather more difficult task, and
some knowledge of the rules of the art of painting in general will be found most
useful. The colours and brushes to be used are sold in boxes, and the number of
colours can be readily increased by mixing. The following articles may be
considered necessaries. Easel, glass to paint on, pencils, dabbers, etching-needles,
fixing varnish, and the following colours: Blue, Nos. 1 and 2, crimson, amber,
brown, mauve, black, light green, dark green, orange, purple, and scarlet. Having
obtained these articles, proceed as follows. Make a drawing of the picture required,
of the right size, on white paper, and place this under the glass upon which the
picture is to be painted. The outline is then to be traced on the glass in Indian
ink with a fine pen. This part of the work, however, can be dispensed with if the
glasses be bought having pictures already outlined on them. If the subject of the
picture be a landscape, the outlined glass is to be turned upside down, and the sky
filled in first, commencing at the horizon with a pale tint, which is to be increased
in density as the edge of the picture is approached. To remove any superfluous
colour, a dabber is used.</p>

<p>When this colour has dried, the other parts of the picture are painted in
succession with appropriate tints, warm tints being employed for the objects in the
foreground, neutral or cool tints for the background.</p>

<p>This having been done, the picture has then to be coated with the fixing varnish,
either using a brush or pouring it on as a photographer would do; or, when it has
covered the surface, allowing it to run back into the bottle from one of the corners.
The varnish is then allowed to dry, after which the picture is again to be examined,
the shadows of the buildings and the trees are to be filled in, and the colour
strengthened where the picture seems to need it. Snow and moonlight effects are
produced chiefly by removing the colour in places by means of a knife and needle-point.</p>

<p>The rules given above apply also to the colouring of photographs for the magic
lantern.</p>

<h4>II. <span class="smcap">How to Make a Cheap Magic-Lantern.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">By Frank Chasemore.</span></h4>

<p>If you were to go to a shop to buy a lantern like the one I am going to describe, it
would cost thirty-five shillings, but you will be able to make it for fourteen or fifteen.
I will tell you what mine cost me, including the slides. The lantern cost me fifteen

<p class="noindent">making a clear saving of &pound;25.</p>

<p>Besides this, you have the double pleasure of making the lantern and painting
the slides, and showing it as your own work. The picture shown by this lantern
will be nine or ten feet in diameter, and will be large enough to show full-sized
slides if you should at any time buy any. If you do buy, I should recommend the
uncoloured photographs (1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> each), to be got at all shops where they sell
lanterns. By making two of these lanterns you can use them for dissolving views,
which is by far the best way to exhibit the slides. Many brilliant effects can be
obtained with two lanterns that it would be impossible to do with a single lantern.
I should certainly advise you to try this. Both lanterns can be made at the same
time; the directions for one will do for both. But we must get on with our
description.</p>

<p>First of all get a carpenter to cut you a deal board, free of knots, six feet six
inches long, nine inches wide, and half an inch thick. This must be planed smooth
on both sides. If you have a plane, do this yourself. Now with a fine saw cut four
pieces off the board, each twelve inches long, and two pieces nine inches
long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
These are to make the body of the lantern with. Take two of the long pieces and
the two short pieces, and reduce the width to six inches. These will be the top,
bottom, back, and front of the lantern. Now you must put the pieces together by
dovetailing; or you had better get the carpenter to do this for you, as unless you
are used to this work you would be sure to make a mess of it. Do not glue the
pieces together yet. Take the piece of wood that is to serve for the top, and draw
lines with a pencil from opposite corners, like <a href="#FigXX01b">Fig. 1</a>. Now with a pair of compasses,
open one inch and a half apart, put one point at the point where the two lines cross
each other, and mark a circle with the other point. This circle must be cut out
either with a keyhole saw or with a gouge, smoothing off with a rough file.</p>

<img src="images/illo232b.png" alt="magic lantern" width="283" height="117" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>

<p>Now take the piece of wood that is to be used for the front of the lantern and
draw a pencil line across it, two inches from the top end, and then cross the other
part with pencil lines (<a href="#FigXX02b">Fig. 2</a>), as you did the top, and with the compasses open an
inch and three-quarters make a circle as before and cut it out. Now take the piece
of wood to be used for the right side of the lantern and mark it thus (<a href="#FigXX03b">Fig. 3</a>). Draw
lines across each end two inches from the edges, and along the side one inch and a
half from the edges. Cut out the middle portion evenly up to the lines. This will
form the door, and if you have cut the piece out with a keyhole saw it will do to be
fastened on with hinges. If not, you must make another piece for the door. Now,
round the bottom of the two sides and back bore holes with a half-inch centrebit.
These holes must be one inch and a half from the centre of the hole to the edge of
the wood. Three in the back piece and four in each side will be enough. These
holes are to supply air for the lamp. Now you will want some sheet tin to line the
lantern with. This you must buy. Get two and a half sheets of thin, and two and
a half of very stout. The thin will be threepence each, the stout sixpence each.
Cut pieces from the thin tin to line the lantern with&mdash;two pieces eight inches by ten
inches, two pieces five by eight, one piece five by ten, and
one piece five by eleven. Punch holes
all round each of these pieces. This can
be done with the sharp end of a file.
Put the tin in its place on the top, front,
and right side, and mark on it, through
the holes, their exact size, and cut the tin away a little larger than the holes.
Now you can put the linings in their places and fasten on with small tacks. Those
used by upholsterers are the best. The tin at sides, back, and front, is cut short, so
as not to cover the holes at the bottom. The tin can be easily cut with a large pair
of scissors. The door must be lined with tin. When all the parts are lined
you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
can glue the joints and put the body together, fastening with small brads. This can
now be put on one side to dry and set firm, as we shall next set to work to make the
stage and nozzle.</p>

<p>Before you can do so you must get your lenses and reflector. These will cost
you more than any other part of the lantern twice over. The lenses will be
10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and the reflector 2<i>s.</i> Ask for, or write for, a pair of lenses for No. 6<span class="smcapall">A</span>
lantern, three and a half inches, and a four-inch reflector. First of all we must
set the lenses. Take the largest, and cut a strip of thin tin half an inch wide,
and long enough to go right round the lens and lap an eighth of an inch. The
best way to measure this is with a piece of paper, cut into a strip and passed
round the lens, and cut to the exact length of the circumference of it. Place
this paper on your tin and cut the latter an eighth of an inch longer than the paper.
You must now solder the ends of this strip of tin together to make a ring. To
do this you must have a soldering bit, and as this is always useful you had better
buy one.</p>

<p>Take a small piece of clean tin, put on it two or three drops of chloride of
zinc, and in this put a small piece of solder. Put the bit in the fire to get hot&mdash;but
not red-hot. When hot, rub the point with a file till it is bright, and put it on the
solder, which will immediately flow and cover the point of the bit. This is called
tinning the bit, and must always be done when the bit gets red-hot, as that burns off
the tinning.</p>

<p>Put your bit in the fire to get hot, and while it is there bring the ends of the
tin strip together so that they lap an eighth of an inch. Dip a camel-hair brush in
the liquid and rub the joint between the lapping and an eighth of an inch outside.
Put a small piece of solder at the top of the joint. Now if the bit be hot enough
put it on the solder, and, as soon as it has melted it, draw it slowly along the joint,
and the solder will flow after it and make a firm joint. In making joints like this,
the parts of the tin lapping must touch each other closely. When the joint is cold,
take a small hammer and turn in one edge all round a sixteenth of an inch. This
will be easily done by gently tapping the edge with the hammer over a piece of
wood, such as a toothpowder-box or ribbon-roller. In doing this you must be
careful not to put the band out of the round. When this is done, put the lens
inside, resting on the turned-in part. Now get a piece of brass wire a sixteenth of
an inch thick, and about a quarter of an inch less in length than the tin strip was,
and bend it into a ring, but do not fasten the ends together. Put the ring inside
the band against the lens, and it will spring against the sides and hold the lens firmly
in its place. This lens, with its setting, is to be placed inside the lantern in the
large hole in the front of it, with the lens towards the back of the lantern.</p>

<p>Now we must set the other lens. Take a piece of the thin tin two and a half
inches wide, and long enough to go round the lens and lap an eighth of an inch. In
cutting this you must be careful to keep the sides and angles square, or it will not
be true when made into a tube. Now get a roller for silks about an inch and a
half thick and roll the tin round it to make a tube by bringing the shortest edges
together. Be careful to make the tube nice and round and smooth; lap the edges
an eighth of an inch, and solder them together as you did the other tube. Turn in
one edge all round a sixteenth of an inch, put the lens inside, resting on
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
turned-in part, and fix it with a wire ring. Now take a strip of tin an inch wide and
long enough to go round this last tube and lap an eighth of an inch. Bring
the edges together, lapping an eighth of an inch, and solder.</p>

<p>This is the tube to be fixed in the nozzle, for the front lens tube to slide in, to
regulate the focus. Round this little tube, half an inch from the edge, mark a line.</p>

<p>Now we will get on with the stage. For this you will use your stout tin. Take
one of the plates and mark on it a piece five inches by eight, being very careful to
make it quite square at the corners. Cut this piece of tin out. Now draw a line
across each end at half an inch
from the edge, and another line
an inch and a half from the
edge (<a href="#FigXX04b">Fig. 4</a>). Cross the middle
portion by lines drawn from
opposite corners, and with your
compasses mark a circle three
inches and a half in diameter.
Cut out this circular portion,
being careful not to bend the
plate; but if you do you must
straighten it again with a piece
of wood, bend the ends down
along the inner line till they are
at right angles with the other
part of the plate (<a href="#FigXX05b">Fig. 5</a>). Now bend the tin outwards along the other lines till it is
at right angles to the other part (<a href="#FigXX06b">Fig. 6</a>). Punch two holes about an eighth of an
inch wide in each of the turned-out parts. These holes are to screw the stage to the
lantern by. Next you must get two pieces of clock-spring about a quarter of an
inch wide and four inches and seven-eighths long. Bend them into bows about an
inch high, and turn the ends outwards a little (<a href="#FigXX07b">Fig. 7</a>). Solder these into the inside
of the stage by the middle at the top and bottom of the hole (<a href="#FigXX08b">Fig. 8</a>). Cut another
piece of tin seven inches and seven-eighths by seven inches and a quarter, and cut a
circular hole in the middle four inches in diameter. Mark a line across each end an
inch and an eighth from the edge, and bend the plate at right angles at each
end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
This is to make the spring clip to hold the slides; it is put inside the stage, resting
on the springs, and with the turned-out parts outside (<a href="#FigXX09b">Fig. 9</a>).</p>

<p>In cutting the tin for the next part, you must be careful to keep the sides and
angles square; also in bending it into a tube
and soldering it. Mark out on your tin
plate (stout tin) a piece eleven and a
quarter inches long and four and one-eighth
inches wide, turn this into a tube by bringing
the shortest edges together round a
bottle, lap them a quarter of an inch, and
solder the joint; now very carefully turn
out one edge all round, one-eighth of an
inch, being careful not to disturb the round.
This can be done against the edge of a
flat-iron by gently tapping with your small
hammer. Cut out a circular piece of tin three inches and a half in diameter, and in
the centre cut out a circular hole exactly the size of the small tube the lens-tube
slides in; pass this tube half way through this hole, and solder it in, being careful
that it is squarely in; now put this piece into the end of the large
tube, not the turned-out end, so that the side that is soldered is
inwards, and solder this on the inside of the tube. Next solder
this tube, which is the nozzle of the lantern, on to the outside of
the stage, being careful that the holes in the stage and tube correspond.
You had better strengthen the stage by soldering corner
pieces in where the turn-out parts are (<a href="#FigXX10b">Fig. 10</a>). Now the stage
and nozzle is ready to be screwed into its place on the front of
the lantern, being careful that the centre of the holes are all in
the same straight line; but before screwing it on, all the tin
visible must be blackened with dull black paint, which I will tell
you how to make at the end of this section. The inside of the
lantern must also be painted with this black paint, as well as the
inside of the front lens-tube. In this tube there must be what is called a diaphragm.
To make this, take a piece of thin tin an inch and a quarter wide, and long enough
to go round the inside of the lens-tube; solder the edges together, and close the
end with a circular piece of tin with a circular hole in the
middle of it a little less than half an inch in diameter. Blacken
this and push it into the tube, so that the little hole is about
half-way in. The lens-tube is to be pushed into the nozzle
with the lens inside. To make the chimney, take a piece of
tin six inches wide and nine inches and three-quarters long,
bend it into a tube, and lap a full eighth of an inch; solder up
the joint; then cut four notches in the top about three-quarters
of an inch deep (<a href="#FigXX11b">Fig. 11</a>).</p>

<p>Now mark on a piece of tin a circle four inches and a quarter radius, or eight
and a half inches wide; cut this circle out. Now cut out a quarter of the circle
(<a href="#FigXX12b">Fig. 12</a>), bring the cut edges together, lap them a little,
and solder the joint, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
it makes a small tin cone (<a href="#FigXX13b">Fig. 13</a>). Put this on to the four points on the top of the
chimney-tube, and solder those points into it securely, and your chimney will be finished
and look like <a href="#FigXX14b">Fig. 14</a>. This must be pushed into the hole at the top of the lantern.</p>

<p>Now for the lamp, and your lantern will be finished. You had better make
this, as it would cost you 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to buy, and you have nearly all the materials
required. Cut a piece of stout tin nine inches and three quarters long and three
inches and three quarters broad; make it into a tube by joining the short edges
together, lapping them a little, about an eighth of an inch, and soldering the joint.
For the bottom cut a piece of tin round, the exact size to fit tightly into the tube;
in the middle of this cut a circular hole three-quarters of an inch in diameter,
solder this in the lamp so that it is half an inch from the bottom end, and then cut
the half-inch that projects like you did the top of the chimney. Now make a
tube of tin to fit the hole in the bottom, and long enough to come level with
the top of the lamp; solder this up, and into its place in the lamp (<a href="#FigXX15b">Fig. 15</a>). Next
you must get a short piece of brass curtain-rod that will just fit tightly over this
last tube and be the same length. In this brass tube you must cut a spiral slot,
running from top to bottom, and going once round. The slot is to be cut quite
through the brass (<a href="#FigXX16b">Fig. 16</a>). The best way to do this is to cut a piece of wood,
about eight inches long, and thick enough to fit very tightly in the brass tube; then
with a sharp file make your cut. The cut is to be about one-sixteenth of an inch
wide. Now push this brass tube on to the tube in the lamp, and fix it by pressing
the brass in a little.</p>

<p>The next thing to make is the wick-carrier. Make a short tube of tin three-fourteenths
of an inch long, and to fit easily over the brass tube; round the bottom
of this short tube put a band of stout tin one-fourth of an inch wide; through this
band drill a hole one-sixteenth of an inch, and solder a sixteenth-of-an-inch wire
through it, so that it projects one-eighth of an inch inwards, and one-eighth of an
inch outwards. This little wick-carrier must be notched with a penknife (<a href="#FigXX17b">Fig. 17</a>),
so that it is covered with little points directed downwards; these points are to catch
in the wick and hold it firmly.</p>

<p>If this wick-carrier is put on the brass tube in the lamp, with the inside point in
the spiral slot, as it descends it will turn to the left, and as it is lifted up it will turn
to the right; consequently if it is turned to the right or left, it will ascend or
descend, according to the way it is turned. To turn this wick-carrier we must have
the following contrivance: Cut out a circular piece of stout tin that will fit easily
into the lamp, and in the centre cut out a circular hole that will allow the wick-carrier
to pass easily through it. At one side of this circular hole cut a little slot
one-eighth of an inch each way (<a href="#FigXX18b">Fig. 18</a>). Next make a tube of tin that will fit
inside this hole, and will let the carrier pass freely up and down inside, but the
edges of the tin must not be joined, but be an eighth of an inch apart. Solder this
tube in its place in the circular tin, projecting through about a quarter of an inch,
and so that the opening down the side of the tube corresponds with the square slot
in the top. Solder a band of tin one-eighth of an inch wide all round the bottom of
this tube to keep it firm (<a href="#FigXX19b">Fig. 19</a>). Punch a hole in the top about a quarter of an
inch from the edge, and fix a one-sixteenth wire in it about half an inch long.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX20b">
<img src="images/illo237d.png" alt="magic lantern" width="350" height="61" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 20.</p>
</div>

<p>Put this tube over the brass tube, so that the slot at top corresponds with the
top of the spiral slot. Put the wick-carrier in its place, with the inner point in the
spiral, and the outer point in
the slot in the tube; and by
turning the top to right or
left the wick-carrier will ascend
or descend, and, when
the wick is fixed to it, will
raise or lower the wick. To turn this top something more is wanted&mdash;that is, a
movable top to carry the lamp-glass; this can be made to turn the movable top to
raise the wick-carrier. For this you must get a piece of sheet-brass or copper&mdash;brass
will look best, but copper is easiest worked. Whichever you decide upon, it must
be a circular piece three and a half inches in diameter, and less than one-sixteenth
of an inch thick. This copper is to be worked into the shape of a felt hat, with a
crown three-quarters of an inch high, and one and a half wide. To do this you
must make a block of hard oak wood six inches square and three inches thick;
cut a hole in the middle the shape and size of the crown of the hat; this is to be like
half a ball (<a href="#FigXX20b">Fig. 20</a>).</p>

<div class="figc585">

<div class="figleft" id="FigXX21b">

<p class="caption">Fig. 22.</p>
</div>

</div><!--figc585-->

<p>Now make another block two inches thick and six inches square, and bore a
hole in each corner to screw the two blocks together by with four-inch screws.
Make a hole right through the top block one inch and a half wide. Now make your
copper red-hot and chill it in cold water&mdash;this will soften it; put it on the lower
block with the centre of the copper exactly over the centre of the hole in the block,
place the top block on the copper, and screw the two blocks together as tightly as
you can. Now make a piece of oak three and a half inches long, and one inch and
three-eighths thick, into a roller, and round one end. Put the rounded end in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
hole, resting on the copper, and strike it repeatedly with a heavy hammer or mallet.
This will drive the copper into the hollow in the bottom block. You must make
the copper soft by making it red-hot repeatedly, and you will find that it will be
easily worked into the hollow. As soon as it is forced quite into the hollow in the
lower block you must unscrew the two blocks and finish the fitting by hammering
with a round-faced hammer. Your copper will now be like <a href="#FigXX21b">Fig. 21</a>. Now you
must file off the top of the crown, so as to make a hole at the top three-quarters of
an inch in diameter, like <a href="#FigXX22b">Fig. 22</a>.</p>

<div class="figc500">

</div><!--figc500-->

<p>Next you must cut the brim like <a href="#FigXX23b">Fig. 23</a>, making three projections three-eighths
of an inch wide, and three-quarters of an inch long. Now one-sixteenth of an inch
from the crown of the hat bore a hole one-sixteenth of an inch at the end of each
projection. Bend the outer end of each projecting arm a little less than a quarter
of an inch downwards, till it is at right angles to the other part. Make a ring of
thin tin three-eighths of inch wide, and one inch and five-eighths in diameter; cut the
bottom edge away, leaving three projecting points one-sixteenth of an inch wide and
a quarter of an inch long, equidistant from each other, put these projections through
the little holes round the crown of the hat, and bend them inwards underneath.
This will hold the ring tightly in its place. Now put this hat on the top of the
lamp, and mark on one of the arms the place where the iron wire in the movable
lower top comes, and then bore in that arm a hole one-eighth of an inch in
diameter, and put the top on, passing the upright wire through this hole. Your top
will now be like <a href="#FigXX24b">Fig. 24</a>. The ring is to hold the chimney, and should have four or
five slits in it a quarter of an inch deep, to clip the glass.</p>

<p>Now solder a handle to your lamp. Make a ring of tin a quarter of an inch
wide, and one inch and a quarter in diameter, and solder the two ends to the lamp.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX25b">
<img src="images/illo239a.jpg" alt="magic lantern" width="225" height="460" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 25.</p>
</div>

<p>On the other side you must make the loop to hold the reflector. Take a piece
of tin one inch wide and three inches long, and bend the ends at right angles to the
middle, each end to be three-quarters of an inch long. Solder these ends to the
front of the lamp. On the front of this piece of tin solder another an inch and a
quarter long and three-quarters of an inch wide, soldering only the ends. This
will be the loop to slip the hook on the back of the reflector in, and will keep it in
its place. Your lamp is now quite finished, and will be as represented in <a href="#FigXX25b">Fig. 25</a>.
In fastening on this slip care must be taken to put it in such a position that
when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the reflector is in its place the centre of the reflector will be one inch higher than
the top of the lamp, that is, the cut crown of the hat.</p>

<p>When using the lantern the lamp must be placed under the chimney, and pieces
of board put under it to bring the centre of the reflector opposite the centre of the lens.</p>

<p>Now put a wick in. These wicks are circular, and about three inches and a
half long. When buying them, take your wick-carrier with you to get the right size.
They should fit tightly over this. These wicks can be bought at the lantern-shops,
and are one shilling or one-and-sixpence a dozen. Put oil in your lamp, about
two-thirds full. Light your lamp and put it in the lantern. Put the chimney on,
put the lenses in their proper places, and try the lantern. If it gives a clear, sharp
disc on the wall your lantern is all right, and ready to show the slides. If the disc
is cloudy or has dark patches, move the lamp about till you get it clear. Move the
front lens till the end of the disc is sharp.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX26b">

</div>

<p>You can paint your lantern all over with black paint. Brunswick black is the
best to do this with. It makes the tin parts look nice. If you prefer it, and I
think it is far the best, you can make your lantern of mahogany instead of deal, and
polish it, and blacken the tin parts only. Mahogany board can be got for this very
little dearer than deal. If you were to solder a brass-wire ring round the outside
of the edge of the tube that carries the front lens, it would make it stronger and
easier to regulate the focus, besides giving it a more finished look. If the nozzle
and focusing-tube were made altogether of this brass plate it would add to the finish.</p>

<h4>III. <span class="smcap">How to Make the Slides for a Magic Lantern.</span></h4>

<p>A magic lantern without slides is not of much use. These slides cost a good deal
to buy, the price, ranging from two shillings to a guinea, being regulated by the
time and skill expended in their production. In this section I will tell you how to
make your own slides at a small outlay for materials. The time and skill you must
supply yourselves.</p>

<p>The materials required are&mdash;a glass-cutter; some strips of patent plate-glass
four inches wide&mdash;the glass of the thickness called eleven-ounce glass; thin black
paper, crystal varnish, turpentine, tubes of water-colours, three or four sizes of sable-hair
pencils; a good-sized camel-hair brush, with the hair cut straight off half-way
down, for varnishing; some glue, two or three small dabbers made of fine linen or
kid stuffed with wool, a palette, an easel, and a penknife.</p>

<p>The colours required are opaque black, warm brown, blue, dark green, yellow,
and crimson. The palette can
be made of a piece of glass six
inches square, with a piece of
white paper pasted on the back.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX01c">
<img src="images/illo240.jpg" alt="magic lantern" width="450" height="319" />
<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 1</i></p>
</div>

<p>The easel you can make for
yourselves. <a href="#FigXX01c">Fig. 1</a> will show
how mine is made. A board
twelve inches square and one
inch thick forms the stand. To
this, at about one inch from the
front edge, is fastened by two
hinges another smaller board,
eight inches wide and eleven
inches long from top to bottom,
having a square hole six inches
wide and nine inches long cut
out of it, making it into a frame. This hole is filled with a plate of glass by
glueing strips of wood all round inside the frame at the back for the glass to
rest upon. The front surface of the glass must be flush with the front surface of
the frame.</p>

<p>Up the front of both sides of the frame holes are bored about half an inch
apart for the pegs in the shelf to fit into. This shelf is a piece of wood eight inches
long and half an inch square. In the back of the shelf are fixed two iron pegs,
which fit into the holes in the frame to keep the shelf in position. At each side of
the frame is a wooden support screwed on to the outside by one end, so that it can
be moved freely backwards or forwards, hinge fashion: the free end of each support
fits into holes bored in the stand. By moving the supports backwards or forwards,
and putting them in the holes in the stand, the easel can be lowered or raised at
pleasure.</p>

<p>The upper surface of the stand is covered with white paper. You will require a
hand-rest to keep the hand from touching the painting. This is made out of a
piece of thin wood (cigar-box wood does nicely) eight inches long and one inch
wide.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
To one side of this, at each end, glue a piece of the same wood one inch square,
and in these pieces fix the iron pegs to fit into the holes in the frame of the easel.</p>

<p>When using the easel place it with its back to a window, or if you are painting
by gas or lamp light place it so that there is a strong light on the white paper under
the glass.</p>

<p>The glass to be painted is to be put on the glass of the easel resting on the shelf.
When you have finished painting for the day you need not remove the picture from
the easel if it is not finished, as by fixing the hand-rest over it and shutting down
the easel you can cover the whole with a sheet of paper, and so protect it from dust.
Now you have everything you want, and we will set to work at the painting.</p>

<p>First take your strips of glass, and with your glass-cutter cut them into pieces
four inches square. Take one of these squares and well clean it on both sides.
Put a little of each colour on your palette. Now place your glass over the design
you wish to transfer to it, and very carefully go over the outline with your finest
sable-hair pencil dipped into the opaque black moistened with a little water.</p>

<p>While this is drying mix in a small bottle some crystal varnish and turpentine in
the proportion of one part varnish and two parts turpentine. When the outline is
dry take it in your left hand, with the thumb on one edge and the fingers on the
other. Dip the varnish brush into the varnish mixture, drain it partly on the mouth
of the bottle, and carefully, with a light and free hand, go all over the glass, drawing
the brush from top to bottom, beginning at the left-hand edge and working to the
right.</p>

<p>Do not go over the varnish twice, or you may disturb the outline. Set the glass
on one side to dry, but do not put it where it will get hot, or this may crack and
streak the varnish.</p>

<p>While this is drying, take another glass, clean it, and trace outline of number
two picture, varnish, and proceed with number three, and so on till you have six
glasses outlined and varnished. It is better to have more than one picture to work
upon at the same time; you do not then have to wait for the varnish to dry, as you
can be colouring one while the other is drying.</p>

<p>When the varnish is dry, which will be in about a quarter of an hour, put one
of the glasses, with the varnished side up, on to the easel, place the easel in a good
light, and proceed to put in the colours. Put in the sky and background of the
pictures first. The sky and all large surfaces must be put in as evenly as you can
with the brush, and then you must go all over them with a fine dabber till you have
got them perfectly even. In dabbing a surface such as a sky, do not mind dabbing
the colour over other parts of the picture, as all the colour not wanted in it can be
taken out with the moistened point of a brush before varnishing. When I paint
my slides I sometimes purposely colour all over anything that projects into the sky,
as I find I can get a more even surface by doing so.</p>

<p>When you have been all over the picture with the first coat of colour, varnish as
before, and proceed with the second and third coats. You must be very careful in
varnishing the colours, and not go over them twice. The colours are to be got at all
artists&#8217; colour shops. Ask for tubes of water-colours for glass-painting. Some of
the larger firms also publish little books on glass-painting, in which you will find
many useful hints.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>When the colouring of the picture is finished, varnish it all over for the last
time, and set on one side to dry. Now cut some squares out of your black paper
the exact size of your glasses, and cut from the centre of each a circular hole three
and a half inches in diameter; place one of these pieces on each of the varnished
pictures (on the varnished side); take, and clean, six other glasses, and place one
on each of the paper squares on the pictures; next fasten the two glasses together
by glueing a narrow strip of paper all round the edges of each pair, and lapping on
to each glass not more than one-eighth of an inch.</p>

<p>When they are quite dry your slides are ready for the lantern, and the pictures
being inside between the two glasses, will be protected from injury from dust or
scratches. In putting the slides into the lantern the painted glass should be
nearest the light, if to be shown through a transparent screen; and the other glass
nearest the light if to be shown on to a wall or opaque screen.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX02c">
<img src="images/illo242a.png" alt="magic lantern" width="350" height="285" />
<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 2</i></p>
</div>

<p>These slides will be too small to use in the lantern by themselves, so you will
have to make a wooden slider for them. This is made as in <a href="#FigXX02c">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX03c">
<img src="images/illo242b.png" alt="magic lantern" width="350" height="340" />
<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 3</i></p>
</div>

<p>Take two pieces of board one-eighth of an inch thick, four and a half inches
wide, and eight inches long, with a square hole cut in each three and three-quarter
inches square. These boards make the back and front of the slider, and are joined
together at the top and bottom by two narrow strips of wood eight inches long, a
quarter of an inch wide, and one-eighth of an inch thick. This slider is pushed
into the slide-stage of the lantern, and the glass slides pushed into it as in <a href="#FigXX03c">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

<p>The slider is rather smaller than the stage in the lantern, which allows of it
being adjusted so that the centre of the picture is in a line with the centre of the
lenses.</p>

<p>For making movable slides, such as slipping-slides, lever-slides, rack-slides, and
chromatropes, you will require wooden frames.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>To make these frames, get a carpenter to cut you some slips of pine or deal
three or four feet long and half an inch square, with a groove running all along one
side of each slip say one-eighth of an inch deep and one-sixteenth of an inch wide.
Make your frames out of these slips of wood, seven inches long and four inches
wide, outside measuring. Fit a glass in the groove like a slate is fitted in its frame.</p>

<div class="figc620">

<div class="figleft" id="FigXX04c">

<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 5</i></p>
</div>

</div><!--figc600-->

<p>Make about a dozen of these frames, and set them on one side to dry. Now
cut some strips of glass three inches wide and seven inches long, and cut off one
corner of each, as in <a href="#FigXX04c">Fig. 4</a>, at any convenient angle, and then cut away the upper
half of the front part of each frame flush with the glass, to allow the second glass
to be pulled out about half an inch when put in position in the frame, as in <a href="#FigXX05c">Fig. 5</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX06c">
<img src="images/illo243b.png" alt="magic lantern" width="350" height="427" />
<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 6</i></p>
</div>

<p>Your frames are now ready to receive the design. Trace the design on the
inside of the fixed glass with the effects; if it is to be a figure raising and lowering
its arm, the figure must be drawn with three arms&mdash;viz., the arm that is not raised
and the other arm in each position, one up and the other down, as in <a href="#FigXX06c">Fig. 6</a>. The
other glass has nothing on it but two black patches, one or the other of which covers
one or the other of the arms as the glass is pulled out or pushed in.</p>

<p>In painting these slides, all the glass in the frame around the figures is to be
blackened with the opaque black, so that all light is excluded except that which
comes through the figures. When this slide is painted, varnish it and paste a
narrow strip of paper on the top and bottom of the glass for the movable glass to
slide on without scratching the picture.</p>

<p>The black patches on the movable glass are painted and varnished on the
inside of the glass. To get these in the right place, place the glass in position over
the picture, and when pushed in as far as it will go, mark with your black on the
outside of the glass the outline of the arm that is to be covered in that position;
then pull out the glass as far as it will go and mark in the same way the outline
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the other arm; turn the glass over and fill in the outlines with opaque black, and
on putting the glass in its place in the
frame you will have a figure with its arms
raised or lowered. Now put the glass in
its place, and fix it there by pressing into
the wood of the frame two small pins at
the top and two at the bottom. In
putting in these pins allow room for the
glass to slide easily.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX07c">

<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 8</i></p>
</div>

<p>The construction of lever slides is
something like that of the slipping slides,
except that the movable glass is circular,
and the picture on the glass in the frame
is painted circular and has a background.
The movable glass has painted on it
only the limb that is to be moved. You
can get these circular glasses cut at a
glazier&#8217;s; have them three inches in diameter. <a href="#FigXX07c">Fig. 7</a> will explain how the two
glasses are to be painted. By placing the movable glass over the fixed glass, and
moving it partly round
and back again, the
two boys will appear
to move up and down.
Of course the point
that the board hinges
on must be in the centre
of the picture. Before
painting the picture,
cut out a piece of
thin board a quarter of
an inch thick, three
inches wide, and six
inches long. Cut this
in the shape of <a href="#FigXX08c">Fig. 8</a> (the dark part represents the wood). Glue this wood
on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to the glass inside the frame, and cut away the front edge of the frame down to
the glass.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Fig. 10</i></p>
</div>

<p>Now you can paint your picture, and while that is drying take one of your
circular glasses and fit a rim&mdash;made of thin brass plate, a sixteenth of an inch thick&mdash;to
it. This rim is to fit the glass tightly, and is to be a quarter of an inch wide;
the ends are to lap a little, and are to be soldered together. Now cut from the
same brass plate a strip two and a half inches long and a quarter of an inch wide,
and solder this on to the rim, as in <a href="#FigXX09c">Fig. 9</a>. Fix the circular glass in this rim, and
on the inside paint the board and children on it, put it in its place in the circular
hollow in the frame, and fasten it in its place with small pins pressed into the wood
and bent over the brass rim (<a href="#FigXX10c">Fig. 10</a>). By raising or lowering the lever the board
will rock up or down.</p>

<p>Rack slides are very like the last description of slide, but in these the movable
glass is capable of being moved quite round by a rack-and-pinion work.</p>

<h4>IV. <span class="smcap">Revolving Slides for the Magic-Lantern, without Rack-work.</span><br />

<p>In my last section on magic-lantern slides, I mentioned that, although the frames
for rack-work slides could be purchased, they were expensive. I have since then
thought that the old-fashioned way of turning the revolving part&mdash;viz., by pulley
and band&mdash;would be easy for boys to make, and answer very well if the cord is
kept tight. In this section I give instructions
in making these frames.</p>

</div>

<p>Make the outside frames five inches
wide and ten inches long, out of wood
half an inch by three-eighths, put edgeways.
Cut a piece of thin deal or
mahogany three-eighths of an inch
thick and five inches square, and glue
this on one side of half the frame (as
<a href="#FigXX01d">Fig. 1</a>). Cover the other half with a
piece of glass four and a half inches
square, and fasten it there with strips
of deal, making them flush with the board on the other half. Glue corner-pieces
(as in <a href="#FigXX04d">Fig. 4</a>) on the other side of the glass, turning the frame over.</p>

<p>Make the circular frames out of a wooden circular box&mdash;such as a tooth-powder
box&mdash;about four inches in diameter. Take off the lid and cut away the
rim that it fits on, and saw the box into rings about a quarter of an inch wide,
marking the box first with a pencil, and cutting through the marks with a
fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
saw (as <a href="#FigXX02d">Fig. 2</a>). Have your circular glasses cut the exact size of the inside of these
rings. Fix the glass in each ring so that the wood projects a trifle beyond the
glass on one side. With a three-cornered file cut a triangular groove all round each
ring about one-sixteenth of an inch deep.</p>

<p>Make the small wheel out of a cotton-reel about an
inch or an inch and a quarter in diameter. Cut off
the ends and cut the other part into slices a quarter
of an inch wide, and cut a groove about an eighth of
an inch deep all round each (as <a href="#FigXX03d">Fig. 3</a>). On one side
of each of these pieces fix a short wire about three-quarters of an inch long near
the edge; this wire will serve as a handle to turn the wheel by. Fasten this small
wheel to the board by a screw that fits easily into the hole in the centre, without
too much play (<a href="#FigXX04d">Fig. 4</a>). Put the circular glass and frame in its place and glue a
piece of wood (<span class="smcapall">A</span>, <a href="#FigXX04d">Fig. 4</a>),
about two inches wide and a
quarter of an inch thick, to
the wooden half of frame.
Get two small glass beads
about a quarter of an inch
long and an eighth of an inch
wide. Put a wire about an
inch long through each, and
bend the wires as in <a href="#FigXX05d">Fig. 5</a>.
Sharpen the ends and press
them into the edge of the
wood (<span class="smcapall">A</span>, <a href="#FigXX04d">Fig. 4</a>, <span
class="smcapall">B</span> <span class="smcapall">B</span>), so that
the beads will turn easily without touching the wood. Cut away a semicircular
portion of the end of the frame (<a href="#FigXX04d">Fig. 4</a>) and fasten a small button made of brass
plate in it, and fasten another button to the wood (<span class="smcapall">A</span>). These buttons will keep the
circular frame in its place. Connect the two wheels with a piece of strong twine,
not too thick, going round
them both, and fasten the
ends by lapping them and
sewing them together.
Now if
you turn the
small wheel the
large circular
frame will turn
round in the
same direction if
your work is well done.
The edge of the circular
frame must not touch anything but the glass it rests on, the two beads, and the
two buttons. The view is painted on the inside of the fixed glass, and the
revolving portion is painted on the under side of the circular glass. In
<a href="#FigXX04d">Fig. 4</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the mill and background are painted on the fixed glass, and the sails on the
movable one.</p>

<p>Chromatropes can be made in the same way, except that the small wheel has
two grooves in its edge, and the other part is made up of two revolving frames,
which are turned in opposite directions by one cord passing round both and the
small wheel. The lower frame rests on the square glass, and the other frame rests
on the lower one. The cord is passed from the right-hand side of the lower groove
in the small wheel up the right side of the lower frame, round the top and down the
left side to the left side of the upper groove in small wheel, round the upper groove
to right side up to the left side of upper frame, round the top down the right side of
frame to left side of lower groove of small wheel, brought round, and the two ends
joined. It will be seen that by putting the cord this way the two frames are turned
in opposite directions, although the small wheel turns them both. Have the cord
tight, and well rub all the parts that work together with blacklead.</p>

<p>In painting chromatropes, each glass is painted with the same pattern, and then
they are placed face to face, and in turning make very elaborate and constantly-changing
figures.</p>

<h4>V. <span class="smcap">Screen Frame for the Magic-Lantern.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">By Frank Chasemore.</span></h4>

<p>Great inconvenience is often caused in fixing a screen in a room for the lantern,
such as taking down pictures, etc.; and sometimes it is impossible to hang it without
doing some damage to the walls and paint by driving nails and hooks. Even then
the screen has to be put up in an inconvenient place.</p>

<p>By using the following contrivance all this will be avoided. The screen can be
put in any part of a room most suitable for the show, and afterwards taken to pieces
in a few minutes and packed away in a box thirty-six inches long and about eight
inches deep and wide.</p>

<p>The frame, or stand, can be bought at
the shops, but it is much cheaper to make
your own.</p>

<p>The materials for this frame can be
bought at a small outlay, and are&mdash;fifteen
wooden rods three feet six inches long and
about an inch and a quarter in diameter&mdash;the
handles sold at the shops for fitting to
hair broom-heads do very well indeed, and
are not very dear; two pieces of wood six inches long, five inches wide, and one
inch and a quarter thick; and, lastly, some stout tin plate.</p>

<div class="figc390">

<div class="figleft" id="FigXX01e">

</div>

</div><!--figc390-->

<p>First of all, take the two wooden blocks and cut them the shape shown in <a href="#FigXX01e">Fig.
1</a>; the width at top is three inches, and at the bottom five inches. Divide the top
and bottom lines into two equal parts, and draw a line from top to bottom through
the points of division. On this line mark a point an inch and a half from the top,
and with this point as centre bore a hole right through the wood, which hole is to
be just large enough for the wooden rods to fit tightly into. Draw a line across
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
face of the block half way down (as in <a href="#FigXX02e">Fig. 2</a>). Along this line, and from each end
of it, mark inwards a distance equal to the diameter of the wooden rods, and do the
same along the bottom line (as in <a href="#FigXX02e">Fig. 2</a>). Join these points as in the figure; cut
out the middle portion, leaving the projections three inches long and an inch and a
quarter square. These projections must be rounded by taking off the corners with
a sharp chisel or knife. Trim them down till they are the same size as the rods.</p>

<p>Now you will want your fifteen wooden rods. See that they are all the same
thickness. Cut off the ends of each, to make them quite square, and making the
rods exactly three feet six inches long. From your tin plate cut fourteen pieces,
each piece to be six inches long, and wide enough to go round the rods and to lap
about a quarter of an inch. The width can be found by rolling paper round the
rod and letting it lap a quarter of an inch, and then cutting it off. Place this paper
on the tin and mark the width. The tin can be cut with a large pair of scissors.
Now roll each piece of tin round the rods so as to form fourteen tubes. These
tubes will now require to be soldered. You can get your tinman to do this for
you, or you can do it yourself. If so, the following is the way to do it.</p>

<p>First of all, get some muriatic acid and some clean zinc cuttings. Put the zinc
into a bottle and pour over it the acid, and set it on one side for a time till it has
quite done effervescing; then add a little more zinc, and if it begins again wait a
little longer and add more. Do this till it does not effervesce on putting new zinc
into it, when it is ready for use. You must get some solder from the plumber&#8217;s,
and if you have not a soldering-bit he will perhaps lend you one; but you can buy
the bits now in many shops where they are sold on a card with some solder. The
cost is from one shilling upwards.</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to &#8216;tin the bit&#8217; (or cover the face and point with solder).
This is done as follows. Place the bit in the fire to get hot, but not red. Take a
clean piece of tin-plate and put on it a few drops of the zinc solution, and put a
small piece of solder into it. When the bit is hot enough take it out of the fire, and
with a coarse file clean the face and edges of it, and place it on the solder in the
zinc solution on the piece of tin. In a few seconds the solder will melt and flow
all over the point of the bit. This must be done to the bit every time it gets red-hot,
as in that case the solder is burnt off.</p>

<p>Now put the bit back into the fire and take one of the tin tubes and first clean
the surfaces that lap together by scraping them with a penknife. Rub each surface
with the zinc solution and lap them together, and tie the tube round with string, to
keep the edges in their places. Take the bit out of the fire when it is hot enough,
and place it on the end of the stick of solder, which will be melted and stick to the
bit. Place the bit on the top of the lapping edges, and in a few seconds the solder
will flow from the bit between the surfaces to be joined, and by drawing the bit
from one end to the other it will draw after it the solder and make a strong joint.
If the bit did not at first carry enough solder to make the whole joint, more can be
added by applying the stick of solder to the bit while it is on the joint. Solder the
fourteen tubes, and clean off the joints by scraping and filing the superfluous solder
off and polishing up with a piece of glass-paper. Clean the joint inside well with a
piece of oiled rag to destroy the zinc solution left inside.</p>

<p>Now fit a tube on one end of each of fourteen of the wooden rods. The
tube<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
must be pushed on to the wood so that it is half way, or leaving an empty space of
three inches. The tube can be fixed to the wood by two or three tacks driven
through the tin. The fifteenth rod has no tube to it.</p>

<p>This is all there is to be made for the frame. In putting it together take the rod
without a tube and two others, and join them together like a fishing rod, place each
end of this compound rod into the hole in one of the blocks of wood, fit together
the other rods into sets of three. There will be four of
them. At one end of each set will be an empty tube,
these are to be fitted on the pegs on the blocks at the
ends of the other rod. The frame will now be composed
of two uprights, each made up of two compound rods,
and these support the cross rod or screen roller.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX03e">
<img src="images/illo249a.jpg" alt="magic lantern" width="350" height="237" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>In the bottom rod of each set bore a hole with a
gimlet, as in <a href="#FigXX03e">Fig. 3</a>, and get two pieces of iron wire
about one-quarter of an inch in diameter and bend the
ends at right angles to the other part, leaving this middle part about two feet long.
These are to be fitted to the rods, one to each pair, by pushing the bent ends into
the holes in the ends of the rods as in <a href="#FigXX03e">Fig. 3</a>; they are to be fitted on the outside
of the rods.</p>

<p>Fasten these two wires together by passing a cord round both and tying the
ends together. Sometimes the weight of the screen will cause the roller it is
hung on to &#8216;sag&#8217; or drop in the middle. But by tightening the cord underneath,
the lower ends of the uprights
will be brought towards each
other, and will raise the middle
of the screen roller.</p>

<p>To make the screen you must
get some linen. This can be
bought ten feet wide. Get three
and a half yards of it, and have
it hemmed at the top and bottom.</p>

<p>The top hem must be large enough
for the roller to pass tightly
through. The screen will get
more or less creased in packing,
but will come all right on being
wetted and hung on the roller.</p>

<p>This frame is calculated for a
ten-foot screen, which will be
found large enough for most
rooms. But it can be made for a larger one by adding one or more rods to each of
the sets. The linen for a larger screen must be joined, as it is not made more than
ten feet wide. In joining linen for this purpose do not let the seam come across
the middle, but add an equal piece at the top and bottom, which will leave the
middle of the picture clear, and the line of the join will come among the dark
features of the foreground, and will not be seen so much. The tin tubes had
better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
be varnished over with Brunswick black, as they will look better and not be liable
to rust. Varnish the iron wires also.</p>

<p>In packing up, the screen must not be rolled on the rods, but had better be
folded up by itself in paper and placed in the bottom of the box, and then the rods
put in afterwards. Otherwise the screen might have some patches of Brunswick
black in the middle of it.</p>

<h4>VI. <span class="smcap">Magic-Lantern for Opaque Slides.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">By W. J. Gordon.</span></h4>

<p>A lantern to exhibit opaque slides or ordinary pictures on paper or cardboard
is, if anything, easier to make than one of the usual type. It is nothing but a
photographer&#8217;s camera with the action reversed. In the camera the large well-lighted
object is focussed down by the lens into the miniature copy in the darkened
box; in the lantern the miniature in the well-lighted box is focussed up into the
enlarged copy in the darkened room.</p>

<p>The essentials are, a good lens, a good light, and a well-focussed, well-illuminated
picture. Any ordinary box will do. Its shape and size are of little moment,
but the box must be blacked inside and have the top replaced by or covered with
tin or sheet-iron. Let it be, as we have to make
one, say eighteen inches long and two feet high.
The depth of the lantern depends on the focal
length of the lens you have chosen for it. This
lens can be either a plain magnifying-glass, such
as is used in cheap lanterns of the common build,
or it may be compound, of the sort used in
portrait cameras. The compound lens will give
the best results. Suppose we are dealing with a
three-inch lens having a focal length of ten inches,
our box should then be ten inches deep. Very
much smaller boxes with less powerful lenses can
of course be made, and they will act just as satisfactorily.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX01f">
<img src="images/illo250.jpg" alt="magic lantern" width="450" height="324" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>The top, as we have said, should be covered with tin, to prevent its catching
fire, and it should be fitted with a chimney made by bending a sheet of tin and
soldering its edges together. In order that a circle of light may not be thrown on
to the ceiling, a cap must be fitted over the top so as to leave ample space for the
passage of the heated air. In the front of the box a tube must be fitted, just large
enough to hold another tube, in which the lens is held, and by this contrivance
perfect adjustment of the focus is assured.</p>

<p>Arrange the interior as shown in the sketches, which are so numerous and
self-explanatory that lengthened description is not required. The only peculiarity
is in the back, which is so made to prevent a flood of light being thrown out behind
each time a picture is changed. There are two doors to it, one being just a
quarter the size of the other, and having a piece of wood of the same size
fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
on at right angles of it, on the same principle as is seen in many mahogany
birdcages where the inside flap of the seed or water-carrier just fills the hole made for
the real door when the real door is open. The slide-carrier is marked <span class="smcapall">A</span>, and when
the door is shut the marked side of the shade (<span class="smcapall">B</span>) fits close up against the side of
the box. The lamp is placed as shown, and should be just far enough from the
lens to thoroughly light up the picture without permitting itself to be seen. A
paraffin lamp is the best, and it should if possible have a round argand wick; but
a flat one will do fairly well. The round shape of the wick is suggested as giving
in the majority of instances the most equable light. The bottom of the door
should be cut away slightly or perforated, as in the sketch, so as to allow air to
enter freely, as no lamp will burn without a draught.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX02f">
<img src="images/illo251a.jpg" alt="magic lantern" width="400" height="270" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXX03f">
<img src="images/illo251b.jpg" alt="magic lantern" width="400" height="257" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>It is a good plan to try the chimney on the top before the top is fixed on, and
then if the top is left a little larger all round than will be required it can be shifted
about until the proper position of the lamp with regard to the lens and slides can
be found by experiment, and all risk of failure avoided. When the correct distance
is found the top should be screwed down and trimmed to shape. Inside the box,
below the chimney, a ring or stop should be screwed to prevent the lamp slipping
about in the event of the lantern receiving a sudden knock.</p>

<p>In another form of this lantern the back is in one piece, and the slides are
introduced through a slit at the side, a plan, however, having a few disadvantages.
The principle of the opaque-slide lantern is apparent at a glance, and once that is
understood no difficulty should arise in devising many patterns of the instrument
and utilising old materials for the purpose. Any pictures can be shown, coloured
or uncoloured; even our own designs in this book can be thrown on the screen
with good effect.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI.&mdash;HOW TO MAKE AN APHENGESCOPE, OR APPARATUS
FOR EXHIBITING PHOTOGRAPHS, OPAQUE PICTURES,
AND LIVING INSECTS IN THE MAGIC-LANTERN.<br />
<span class="smcap">By Frank Chasemore.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">In the last chapter there is an illustrated <a href="#Page_250">description</a> of a magic-lantern for
opaque slides, and as I have for some time used a contrivance on the same
principle for use with an ordinary lantern, the few words I have here to say may
not prove uninteresting. Like the opaque lantern, this modification of it is very
inexpensive.</p>

<p>The interest of a magic-lantern is greatly increased by its being made to show
photographs of friends or public men, and also pictures or engravings, Christmas
cards, etc. This can be done by the following simple contrivance, which will cost
but a few pence. Indeed, the one I use cost me only threepence, and is made out
of a cigar-box; but a better and stronger one can be made for less than a shilling.
It consists of a five-sided box, with top and bottom, as seen in <a href="#FigXXI02">Figs. 2</a>,
<a href="#FigXX03a">3</a>, and <a href="#FigXXI06">6</a>.
In two of the sides are circular holes, and one side is left open about two-thirds of
its length, which opening is closed by a door or shutter revolving on a pivot at the
top and bottom, to carry the photograph. This shutter is fitted with four small
clips on each side for the purpose of securing the card in its place.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXI01">

<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

</div><!--figc500-->

<p>Now for the construction. Get some thin board&mdash;deal is very good for the
purpose; it is to be a quarter of an inch thick&mdash;cut two pieces out of it for the top
and bottom, the shape shown in <a href="#FigXXI01">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXI04">
<img src="images/illo253a.png" alt="aphengescope" width="350" height="335" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.</p>
</div>

<p>The dimensions of these pieces are as follows. The sides <span class="smcapall">B</span>
and <span class="smcapall">E</span> four and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
half inches long; the side <span class="smcapall">A</span> five and a quarter inches long; the other two sides
are each to be three and three-quarter inches long. The angles where
<span class="smcapall">A</span> joins <span class="smcapall">B</span> and
<span class="smcapall">E</span> are each to be a right angle; so is the angle
where <span class="smcapall">C</span> joins <span class="smcapall">D</span>. The two other
angles are to be a hundred and thirty-five degrees each, as marked in <a href="#FigXXI01">Fig. 1</a>. The
sides of the box are to be eight inches long each, and are a little less in width than
the edges of the top and bottom that correspond, so that when put together the
outside of the box is flush with the top and bottom. The joints are to be glued
together, and can be strengthened with pins driven in like small nails. The side <span class="smcapall">E</span>
is not to be covered in all the way up, but only about two inches and a half from the
bottom; but this depends upon the height that the nozzle of the lantern comes up
this side when placed against it. <a href="#FigXXI02">Fig. 2</a> shows the opening left. When the glue is
quite dry unscrew the brass focussing-tube from the lantern and place the box with
the side <span class="smcapall">C</span> resting against the nozzle of the lantern, and mark round the nozzle on
the side. Find the centre of this circle, and through it draw a line right across the
side <span class="smcapall">C</span>, parallel to the top and bottom, and continue
this line across the side <span class="smcapall">B</span> in
the same way, as seen in <a href="#FigXXI03">Fig. 3</a>. Find the centre of these two lines, and with
these two centres mark a circle on each of these two sides, the one in the side <span class="smcapall">B</span>
to be of a size to fit the brass focussing-tube, and the one in the side <span class="smcapall">C</span> to be about
three inches in diameter, or large enough
to allow the nozzle of the lantern to fit into
it as far as it will go without coming between
the picture and the lens, as seen in
<a href="#FigXXI04">Fig. 4</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXI05">
<img src="images/illo253b.png" alt="aphengescope" width="200" height="266" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 5.</p>
</div>

<p>The remaining part to be made is the
shutter to carry the photographs. This
must be exactly the same size as the
opening left in the side <span class="smcapall">E</span>, and is to be
made out of the same quarter inch board.
Let it be quite square at the sides and
corners. The opening in the side <span class="smcapall">E</span> is to
be equal in length to twice the distance of
the centres of the holes in the sides <span class="smcapall">B</span> and
<span class="smcapall">C</span> from the top edge
of the sides where
they join the top
board. On each side of the shutter, in each corner, fasten a
clip, as in <a href="#FigXXI05">Fig. 5</a>. These clips can be made out of card or thin
metal, cut in the shape shown, and fastened to the shutter
with small screws or short pins. Mark the middle of the
top and bottom edges of the shutter and place it in its place
in the side <span class="smcapall">E</span>, and mark on the side the points where these
marks come to. Take the shutter out again and bore a hole
in the bottom edge of it about half an inch deep, and large
enough for a stout pin to go into. In the lower part of the
side <span class="smcapall">E</span>, and in the edge that the shutter will rest on, drive
a stout pin in middle so as to form a pivot for the shutter, leaving out about
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
quarter of an inch, and cut off the head. Replace the shutter, fitting the pin into
the hole bored for it, and drive a pin through the top board right into it, so as
to form a second pivot. The shutter will revolve round these two pivots and
expose the sides alternately to the lens. Fix two clips to the edge of the top
board to keep the shutter in place while shut.
Cover the whole of the box with unglazed black

<p>This simple little apparatus is all that is
necessary to show any picture on the screen.
To use it, first screw the tube carrying the
focussing-tube into the hole cut for it in the
side <span class="smcapall">B</span>, and push the nozzle of the lantern
into the hole in the side <span class="smcapall">C</span> as far as it will go.
Light the lantern and place the whole on the
table so that the back of the lantern and the
focussing-tube are directed to the screen, as
seen in <a href="#FigXXI06">Fig. 6</a>. Now place a photograph in the clips on one side of the shutter,
and turn it round and put one in the clips on the other side. The photograph
inside will be strongly illuminated by the light from the lantern, and an enlarged
image of it will be projected by the lens on to the screen. The photographs placed
on the shutter of the aphengescope must be, of course, upside down, as the lens
will have the effect of inverting the pictures.</p>

<p>A strong light is required for this apparatus. The ordinary oil lamp will not
show a bright picture at a distance of more than two or three feet. The
&#8216;Trip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>lexicon&#8217;
lamp, a lamp having three parallel wicks, burning paraffin oil, will give
a good picture. But the best results are obtained from the oxycalcium and
oxyhydrogen burners. These will distinctly show a large and brilliant picture,
at a great distance from the lamp.</p>

<p>With this instrument, a watch placed on the shutter will show an enlarged
image of itself, and the motion of the minute hand will be very distinctly seen.
Anything that will go on the shutter will be shown on the screen. This adds
greatly to the available articles to be used as slides.</p>

<p>Some of the most interesting slides are made by mounting entomological and
botanical specimens on white cards, and putting the cards in the clips on the
shutter, when enlarged images of the butterflies, moths, or beetles, etc., will be
seen on the screen in all the glory of their natural colouring.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXI07">
<img src="images/illo255.jpg" alt="aphengescope" width="350" height="132" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.</p>
</div>

<p>But the most interesting of all is the exhibition of living insects. This can be
done in the following manner. Take out the shutter and lay it on the table: get a
watch-glass, about two inches diameter, and deeply domed. Place this glass on the
middle of the shutter, and with a lead pencil mark all round the glass. Remove
the glass, and with a sharp knife cut into the wood of the shutter all round the
pencil mark, cutting about one-eighth of an inch deep. Cut out all the wood inside
this mark so as to form a hollow or well about two inches diameter and one-eighth
of an inch deep, as <a href="#FigXXI07">Fig. 7</a>. Cut the bottom of the well quite smooth, and line it
with white paper.</p>

<p>Now get a piece of thin glass about the size of a photograph card, and thin
enough to go under the clips on the shutter. Your shutter is now ready for the
specimens. Replace the shutter and put a fly or other small insect into the well,
and cover it with the flat glass, fastening it with the clips. Now turn on the light
in the lantern, and focus the lens, and an
enlarged image of the fly will be seen on
the screen crawling about in a natural
manner. For larger insects, such as a
cockroach, wasp, etc., you must use the
watch-glass to cover them instead of the
flat glass. This can be fixed in its place
by being pushed into the hollow or well,
when the sides or walls will hold it. The
two glasses are required for the reason that the insects ought not to have more
room than will allow them to crawl about on the paper, as they would sometimes
get on the glass, when they would be out of focus of the lens. But the glass must
not be so close to them as to pinch them. You will have to keep your living
specimens in boxes, with air-holes so as to have them ready for the exhibition, and
will also require a small pair of forceps to handle them by, being very careful not
to injure them.</p>

<p>On <a href="#Page_247">page 247</a> I have told you how you can make a light and portable frame
for the screen, at a small cost. Lads who have experimented in chemistry ought
to be able to make the oxygen gas for the oxycalcium light.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXI08">
<img src="images/illo256a.jpg" alt="aphengescope" width="175" height="331" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 8.</p>
</div>

<p>This instrument, as here described, was intended for use only with the tin
lanterns as sold in the shops, which all have tapering nozzles. It can,
however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
be used with the lantern described in my former article, but the stage of that
lantern would require to be modified in the manner shown in <a href="#FigXXI08">Fig. 8</a>.</p>

<p>Unsolder the large nozzle-tube from the front of the stage, and in its place
solder on a band-ring of stout tin. This band is to be one and
a quarter inch deep, and the diameter just enough to allow of the
back end of the nozzle-tube fitting in it very tightly when the
lantern is used in the ordinary way. The small turned-out rim
of the nozzle-tube must be carefully cut off for this purpose. The
aphengescope itself must have a small tin tube fastened in the
small hole in the front of it, for the focussing-tube of the lantern
to slide in; and the large hole must be cut large enough for the
tin band on the front of the stage of the lantern to fit into it.
This arrangement will allow of the light in the lantern being
brought closer to the picture than can be done with the ordinary
lanterns, and will, of course, illuminate it more strongly.</p>

<p>A very good lamp, with high illuminating power, to be used
in any lantern, especially with this instrument, can be bought at
the paraffin-lamp shops for a small sum. The tin duplex
lamp, burning crystal oil, is the best. I should recommend
any of my readers who have made, or are about
to make, the lantern I have described, to get one of
these, instead of making the lamp described with it, as
it will give nearly twice the light. An arrangement will
of course have to be made at the back for the reflector.
If a lamp cannot be got that is low enough for the
lantern, you can make the body of it yourself. You
can generally get, at these shops, damaged lamps at a small
cost. Get one that is damaged only in the body. Unscrew
the brass-work, as though you were about to fill it, and put
it on one side. Unsolder the brass screw-socket from the
reservoir. Now make a square tin box for the new reservoir,
covering in the top. The box is to be an inch and a
quarter deep, and as large as the lantern will allow. In
the top cut a hole to solder the brass screw-socket into.
Then screw in the brass wick-carrier and make the clip for
the reflector.</p>

<p>If a pair of lanterns are used the light will be proportionately
stronger, and a strong light is an important thing with this instrument.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII.&mdash;INGENIOUS ADAPTATIONS FOR THE LANTERN.<br />
<span class="smcap">By W. J. Gordon.</span></h3>

<h4>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chromatropes and Paper Fireworks.</span></h4>

<p class="noindent">From Mr. Chasemore&#8217;s article on revolving slides for the magic-lantern we borrow
the following diagram, as showing very clearly the principle which such slides are
constructed (<a href="#FigXXII01">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<div class="figc620">

<div class="figleft" id="FigXXII01">
<img src="images/illo257a.png" alt="adaptation" width="425" height="190" />

<div class="figright" id="FigXXII02">
<img src="images/illo257b.jpg" alt="adaptation" width="136" height="190" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>

</div><!--figc620-->

<p>Round the slide runs a wooden border half an inch wide and three-eighths of an
inch thick. The right-hand part of the slide is wood, the left glass, and the moving
part showing towards us is also of glass, and fits into a circular wooden ring that is
kept in position as it turns by the two tiny buttons on each side of it. One of these
buttons works on the frame, the other is fastened to a piece of wood glued on to the
wooden part of the slide. Farther to the right is a small silk reel, into which a
handle is fixed, and an endless band from the reel round the circle in the buttons
completes the machinery. All this is simple enough, and as it has already been
described need not be gone into in detail.</p>

<p>The question with us now is how to apply this contrivance to the working of a
chromatrope. A chromatrope is a lantern slide consisting of two or more pieces so
painted as to give the effect on the screen of a set piece of fireworks. It is the
easiest of all slides to paint, as it is purely geometrical, and the colours used require
no mixing, but can be put on at once as they are got from the shop. And, best of
all, the effects produced are far and away more brilliant than anything else in
lantern practice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXII03">
<img src="images/illo258a.jpg" alt="adaptation" width="300" height="297" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>The essentials are a fixed slide of some bold design&mdash;star-shaped, circular,
octagonal, or what not&mdash;and a moving shade that is of spiral pattern. The spiral
pattern is the secret of the whole thing. Let the above be spun behind a star, so
as to be only visible through its rays, and the star will seem to be alive. Turn it
one way, the waves flow outwards; turn it the other, the waves flow inwards.
The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
standing pattern must have a centre, and the spiral must be worked on the same
centre. That done, all is well. Sometimes a double spiral is desirable, and then the
pattern in <a href="#FigXXII03">Fig. 3</a> is adopted. By it the outer part
of the pattern (<span class="smcapall">B</span>) will seem to
flow in a different direction from the inner (<span class="smcapall">A</span>). Paint the spirals
any colours you please, providing that they are bright, and you get
the results. Let reverse spirals appear in your fixed pattern,
and you improve the effect. Have two revolving rings worked
by the same wheel, one over the other, and the whole device
will glow with life and brilliancy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXII04">
<img src="images/illo258b.jpg" alt="adaptation" width="300" height="292" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.</p>
</div>

<p>To begin modestly, take some simple design, such as that
of the fountain in <a href="#FigXXII04">Fig. 4</a>. Paint
it on your slide, and stop it out
all round with asphaltum or any
dense black. Then fix to it a simple spiral disk,
such as that given in <a href="#FigXXII02">Fig. 2</a>, and the instant the
spiral spins the water will begin to flow.</p>

<p>In all designs remember that the fixed slide must
be broken up with black and colour, so as not to
show the whole of the spiral at once. The wave
should, as it were, sweep over the windows. For front
designs nothing is superior to a good knighthood
star.</p>

<p>The colours for slide-painting can either be
bought ready prepared, or ground down on plate
glass and mixed by Canada balsam or mastic varnish. Should the balsam
be too thick, use a little turpentine. The clearest colours are lampblack, burnt
umber, burnt sienna, raw sienna, gamboge, Prussian blue, verdigris, and scarlet
lake, and these are put on in the ordinary way. Before you begin clean
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
glass carefully with a little water and ammonia. Copy the design through the glass,
and it would be as well not to forget that unless you can draw properly on paper you
are not likely to do so on a lantern slide, where in the intense light and enlargement
every mistake and shakiness of line is exaggerated for the benefit of the spectators.
For those who cannot draw, figures of men and animals can be cut out with scissors
and pasted on the slide, so as to give a shadow entertainment, as a change from the
bought slides. Others can buy transparencies and stick them on for themselves,
but the result will never equal hand-painting. One more caution before leaving
hand-painting, and that is, do not be in a hurry, and give your slides at least a
fortnight to dry.</p>

<p>If the spaces of the chromatrope are too narrow, or the design is worked too fast,
you will only produce a fog, just as you do when you spin a toothed wheel. If,
however, the teeth of the two wheels be fixed on the slant and the wheels turned in
opposite directions, the teeth will be visible&mdash;upright if the teeth slant the way the
wheel turns, slanting if they follow the course of the wheel. The principle holds
good with the chromatrope; the spiral is but a toothed wheel.</p>

<p>The chromatrope was invented by Mr. W. Allen. He called it the pyreidotrope.
It was improved, and soon became known as Chinese fireworks. From it the paper
fireworks still popular in some circles were derived.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXII05">
<img src="images/illo258c.jpg" alt="adaptation" width="600" height="294" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 5.</p>
</div>

<p>Paper fireworks are merely large chromatropes painted on oiled paper instead of
on glass, and lighted by candles instead of a lantern. The wheels, and stars, and
plumes, and pyramids are just the same as we have been describing, only much
larger. The transparent portions are got by perforations. The machinery is the
same, but of a rougher pattern, and the moving parts, instead of reels and bobbins,
are barrel-hoops and butter-tubs. From what has been said above, their construction
is sufficiently obvious, and we conclude with a design (<a href="#FigXXII05">Fig. 5</a>) that may serve for
either purpose.</p>

<h4>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Lantern and The Kaleidoscope.</span></h4>

<p>Have our readers ever tried to work these together? If not, let them do so, and
they will be rather surprised at the results. Begin in a small way, and treat the
screen as the broad end of the kaleidoscope. Arrange it at an angle to the audience.
Against it place two mirrors at the desired angle, just as in the well-known instrument,
and then damp the screen and throw the image on from behind, so that it will take
the place of the usual coloured fragments.</p>

<p>Chromatropes can be made in this way by devising a double slide, and filling up
the space between the two sides with stained splinters of glass, beads, etc.; and this
contrivance put into the lantern, and its image thrown on to the screen between the
mirrors, will be multiplied into the most brilliant geometrical fireworks, whose
pattern can be varied as often as desired by simply shaking the glass slide, so
as to rearrange the coloured odds and ends. If the slide is a mechanical chromatrope,
of course so much the better, as instead of one image of it there
are many. Modifications of this experiment will easily suggest themselves to an
ingenious lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<h4>III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Lantern Praxinoscope.</span></h4>

<p>Yet another praxinoscope, and a remarkable one. M. Reynaud is the inventor,
and may well be proud of his ingenious combination. The sketch is so clear
and complete that but little explanation is necessary. In the first place, there
is a magic-lantern; in the drawing it is of the lampascope pattern, in which, by
means of openings at top and bottom fitted with a sheath, an ordinary lamp can be
used, if necessary, instead of the usual light, the chimney of the lamp being hidden
by the top scabbard, and the beam that would illuminate the room being checked
by the cap on the top of it. Any lantern can be altered so as to suit this arrangement,
but the balance must be kept, and there must be no top-heaviness, so as to
upset the lamp, and the under-sheath must be of the right length, so as to bring the
centre of the flame opposite the centre of the lens. Any ordinary lantern with an
ordinary lamp will, however, answer every purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo260.jpg" alt="praxinoscope" width="500" height="470" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>In the side of the lantern an aperture is cut, and around it is fixed a small
triangular box containing a mirror set at an angle of forty-five degrees, and having a
lens, in the base, of a very low power, or hardly any power at all. At the top of
this side-box is fixed an adjustable lens of the same type as that in front of the
lantern. In the lantern itself is placed a slide representing a landscape, an interior,
etc., and the image of this is thrown on to the screen. At the back of the side-box
is placed a praxinoscope of novel construction, and the images from it are thrown
on to the sheet through the lens at its top, so that, as in a dissolving view, we have
the picture seen by the assembly built up out of the slides.</p>

<p>The praxinoscope consists of a crown of mirrors sloping inwards, surrounded by
a ring constructed to take a set of glass slides mounted in a strip by means of
connecting links of silk or calico. The slides consist each of one of the figures
alluded to in the last section, which form the series of instantaneous photographs
that have revolutionised our ideas of the details of motion. They are, in fact,
zoetropic pictures, each differing but slightly in attitude from the other, and each
representing one of the changes assumed in a complete round of some definite
movement.</p>

<p>The slides are slipped into the ring. The light from the lantern shining through
the glass throws the images on to the praxinoscopic mirror, and thence it is reflected
through the top lens on to the screen. The ring and crown are arranged at the
angles given in the cut, and when the slides are revolved by means of the band and
pulley shown below them, the different pictures as they pass the lens are reflected on
to the background, and the figure appears in lifelike movement.</p>

<p>The lantern praxinoscope thus makes the zoetropic effects visible to a large
assembly seated at their ease, and gives pictures of heroic size instead of the tiny
proportions with which, when confined to the ordinary instrument, we are forced to
be content. Many modifications of the arrangement will readily suggest themselves
to our readers, and need not therefore be specially described.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.&mdash;THE BUILDING OF THE SWALLOW; OR, HOW
TO MAKE A BOAT.<br />
<span class="smcap">By E. Henry Davies, C.E.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">Until recently I was among the number of those who, though fond of boating, are
not able to gratify their taste on account of not possessing a boat, or finding it
convenient or possible to hire one.</p>

<p>Well, while walking one fine spring morning along the canal-side, the longing to
be on its surface in a boat of my own became irresistible, and so, not having
sufficient spare money to buy, I there and then determined to build, and I now
purpose telling how I did so, and giving all particulars as to time and cost.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXIII01">
<img src="images/illo265.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="394" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;The Swallow.</p>
</div>

<p>The engraving (<a href="#FigXXIII01">Fig. 1</a>) is a reproduction from a photograph of the Swallow, as she
appeared when on her first trial-trip. Since the taking of the photograph I have
spent many a pleasant, quickly-flying hour in her, either sailing by myself or rowing
with a couple of friends along the waters of a stream which runs clear and slowly
among some of the finest scenery on the North Wales border.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first place, let me give a general description of the boat, with the totals of
time and cost. She is 12 ft. long, 2 ft. 9 in. broad amidships inside, and 1 ft. 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in.
deep inside; of the same shape as an ordinary boat, but made after the style of a
coracle, with a light wood framing, covered over on the outside with stout sailcloth,
coated with three coats of paint to make it watertight. The total cost to me
was &pound;2 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, in addition to which I paid 5<i>s.</i> for a year&#8217;s licence to keep my boat
on the canal. The amount of time spent in building, painting, and rigging was 140
hours, which was extended over two months, owing to my not being able to keep
constantly at work; and this, I should think, would be the average time for any one
working by himself.</p>

<p>A certain amount of skill in carpentry is, of course, needed, as well as a few
tools, but almost as essential as these is a large stock of patience and a firm
resolution to succeed.</p>

<div class="figc600" id="FigXXIII02">

</div>

<p class="largeillo"><a href="images/illo266lg.png">Fig. 2 enlarged</a> (41 kB)</p>

<p>The first thing to be done is to make the inner keel, or keelson (<i>a b</i> of <a href="#FigXXIII02">Fig. 2</a>).
This can be made of deal, and should be planed perfectly straight. Its greatest
length is 10 ft. 10<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. on the upper side; its
breadth is 1 in., and thickness 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in.
The bow end is to be cut off square, and the stern to be cut to a level of 7 in. in a
foot, or an angle of 120 degrees from the horizontal. Commencing at 11 in. from
the bow end, on the upper side, bore a hole three-eighths of an inch in diameter
straight through, and countersink it on the upper side; then make nine more holes
of the same size at distances of one foot apart. These are the holes through which
strong screws 3 in. long will be driven, in order to bind together, after the canvas is
put on, the keelson (<i>a b</i>) and the keel (<span class="smcapall">A B</span>).</p>

<p>The stem piece (<span class="smcapall">C</span>, <a href="#FigXXIII02">Fig. 2</a>) should be made of oak, and of the shape shown in
the figure, which is drawn to a scale of three-eighths of an inch to a foot. The
curve is 9 in. radius, and the total depth 1 ft. 3 in. One strong screw, driven
through the inner keel, or keelson (<i>a b</i>), at the point <span class="smcapall">C</span><sup>1</sup>, will be sufficient to secure
it, as, when the keel is screwed on, another screw at <span class="smcapall">C</span><sup>2</sup> will give it the necessary
strength to resist shocks and blows.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXIII03">
<img src="images/illo267.png" alt="boat section" width="400" height="302" title="1&#8243; = 1 Ft
keelson end
keel end" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap"><i>Fig 3 Stern.</i></span></p>
</div>

<p>The stern piece is formed of two parts (<span class="smcapall">D</span> and
<span class="smcapall">E</span>, <a href="#FigXXIII02">Figs. 2</a> and <a href="#FigXXIII03">3</a>), both of which
should be made of oak three-quarters of an inch thick. The angle of the bevel of
the stem is 120 degrees, or 7 in. in a foot, and when the stern pieces are fixed in
their places on the keel, the slope should be in one line, and the piece <span class="smcapall">E</span> perfectly
at right angles to the keel. <span class="smcapall">D</span> is fixed to the
keelson by two strong screws at <i>d</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
<i>d</i><sup>2</sup>. The width of the transom, or stem piece, <span class="smcapall">E</span>, is at the top 2 ft., and its depth 10
in. As, of course, the outline is the same on either side of the centre line, it will
only be necessary for me to describe the shape of one side.</p>

<p>Beginning, then, at the top on the left-hand side of <a href="#FigXXIII03">Fig. 3</a>, the outline runs
straight for 3 in., sloping inwards at a level
of 1 in 3. After this it follows a curve of
6 in. radius, having its centre at <i>e</i><sup>3</sup>, until
at <i>e</i><sup>5</sup> the curve again bends outwards at
the same radius, and with its centre at <i>e</i><sup>6</sup>
following this curve to the bottom of the
piece, where, at 10 in. from the top, the
width between the two outlines will be
three-quarters of an inch, or the same as
the thickness of <span class="smcapall">D</span>.</p>

<p>Before screwing these two pieces together
eight notches must be cut in the transom
(<span class="smcapall">E</span>) for the reception of the ends of the
laths, four on each side of the centre
line. As, in the course of the construction
of the boat, notches will several times have to be cut, with intervals of untouched
wood, it will be advisable at the first to fix upon some method by which such
notches and spaces may be described. Let, therefore, the spaces to be cut out for
notches be enclosed in brackets thus: (1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,)
2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in., (1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) the figures representing
the breadth of the notch in inches, while the spaces between the notches
are represented by the unenclosed figures.</p>

<p>The notches are throughout <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. deep; those
in the transom (<span class="smcapall">E</span>) are, owing to
the level of the stern, not straight across the wood, and must be marked out with
the bevel, not the square.</p>

<p>Commencing then at the top left-hand corner of the transom (<span class="smcapall">E</span>) at the point <i>e</i><sup>6</sup>
on <a href="#FigXXIII03">Fig. 3</a>, we have the notches to be cut as follows:
(1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in.,
(1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in.,
(1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in.,
(1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 3 in., or four notches and four spaces, the same having, of
course, to be cut in the same order on the other side.</p>

<p>The transom (<span class="smcapall">E</span>) is sunk into the stem piece
(<span class="smcapall">D</span>), as shown in <a href="#FigXXIII02">Fig. 2</a>, and
secured at right angles to it by two screws at <i>e</i><sup>1</sup> and <i>e</i><sup>2</sup>. The whole stem piece can
now be fixed to the keelson (<i>a b</i>) by two strong screws at the points
<i>d</i> and <i>d</i><sup>2</sup>, <a href="#FigXXIII02">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p>The next part requiring attention is the amidships (section <span class="smcapall">F</span>
of <a href="#FigXXIII02">Figs. 2</a> and <a href="#FigXXIII04">4</a>;
see also <a href="#FigXXIII08">Fig. 8</a>); this can be made of deal
<sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. thick, 2 ft. 9 in. wide at the top,
and 1 ft. 3 in. deep. The outline beginning at <i>f</i><sup>1</sup> is for 6 in. straight and at right
angles to a line drawn across the boat, then it follows a curve of 7 in. radius whose
centre is at <i>f</i><sup>2</sup> to the point <i>f</i><sup>3</sup>, which
is 1 ft. 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. below the top and 1 ft. from the
centre line: from this point the outline runs straight until it joins the centre line at
1 ft. 3 in. from the top. A mortise 1 in. wide and 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. deep must be cut in the
centre of this section at the bottom, in order that it may fit accurately over the
keelson and at right angles to it, in which place it is fastened by a strong screw
passing through the keelson from beneath. As its name implies, this section must
be exactly amidships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>The notches and spaces are, beginning at <i>f</i><sup>1</sup>,
(1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 2<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>
in., (1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 2<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,
(1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 2<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>
in., (1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 2<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>
in., (1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 2<sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>
in., (1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 2<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>
in., (1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. mortise
for keelson in centre. The
other side is the same.</p>

to fit over the piece <span class="smcapall">F</span> and
rest on the keel.</p>

<p>The seat must be screwed firmly into its place, so that the future rower may feel
himself in no danger of being precipitated to the bottom of his boat among the
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> of a broken seat.</p>

</div>

<p>There will be two more sections required, somewhat similar to the amidships
one, placed at distances of 3 ft. on
either side of it. We will first take the
one shown as section <span class="smcapall">G H</span> in <a href="#FigXXIII05">Fig. 5</a>,
which is a section along the line <span class="smcapall">G H</span>
of the plan <a href="#FigXXIII08">Fig. 8</a>; which appears on
<a href="#Page_271">page 271</a>.</p>

<p>This can be made in two ways&mdash;either
the same as the amidships one, in a
single piece cut from a soft wood, or in
two pieces cut from a hard wood.</p>

<p>I made mine in the latter way, and
that is the way I shall describe; but in
either case the notches and outline are
the same, and <a href="#FigXXIII05">Fig. 5</a> shows both methods
of cutting the inside, the shaded part
showing the form of the hard wood rib.</p>

<p>The outline can be obtained by reference to <a href="#FigXXIII05">Fig. 5</a>, which is drawn to a scale of
1 in. to the foot.</p>

<p>The centres of the curves are at <i>x x</i>, and the batten of the straight part is 1 in.
in 6 in.</p>

<p>The notches required in each rib are as follows, commencing at <i>g</i><sup>3</sup>:&mdash;(1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,)
2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in., (1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>

the keelson, and the same on the other side. The notch marked A
will be noticed farther on when the time comes for fixing the laths. This section
must be firmly screwed to the keelson at 3 ft. from the bows. A seat is also required
across it, and the remarks made about the amidship seat will apply to
this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
except that, perhaps, this should be made the stronger one, as a hole of 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in.
diameter will be required in its exact centre if it is desired to use the boat for
sailing.</p>

</div>

<p>The other and last section, <span class="smcapall">I J</span>, of Figs. 6 and 8, is to be placed at a distance of
3 ft. aft of the amidships, and should be made of two oak ribs of the shape shown in
<a href="#FigXXIII06">Fig. 6</a>, which should be <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. thick,
and not less than 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. wide in the
weakest place. The notches required
are&mdash;(1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 2<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>
in., (1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in.,
(1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) <sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in.,
(1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. A,) 1<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in.,
(1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 1<sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in.,
(1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in., (1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,)
3 in. keelson, and on the other rib
the same.</p>

<p>A small triangular piece of <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.
oak should be fixed at the upper end
of the stem post, to which the two
upper laths and the gunwales may
afterwards be fixed. The shape and
size are shown at <span class="smcapall">M</span> in <a href="#FigXXIII08">Fig. 8</a>, on
<a href="#Page_271">page 271</a>.</p>

<p>About thirty-five hours will now
have been spent in the building of the boat, and a casual observer would not be
justified in asking what was being made, for the shape of the boat has now become
apparent.</p>

<p>In order to prevent any mishap during the building, it is advisable to screw a
strip of deal across from side to side of each section, and these strips can also be
used for adjusting the position of each section, for if a small hole is bored in the
exact centre of each strip, as well as in the bows and stern, and a small wooden peg
be placed in each hole, it can be easily seen if the sections are in their proper
positions, for, if they are so, the pegs will be in a straight line; and, if not, one or
other of the sections will require adjusting until they are so.</p>

<p>The wood for the laths, keel, and gunwales will now be required; these, of
course, will be obtained from a builder or sawyer.</p>

<p>Elm is the best wood of which to make the laths, as it is capable of being bent
into almost any shape when steamed; in fact, it will be found as well also to make
the keel and gunwales of elm, and if this be decided on the cost of the material and
sawing of the laths, etc., will be 10s.</p>

<p>The lengths for the laths will be&mdash;six, 13 ft. long; six, 12 ft. 6 in. long; and ten,
9 ft. long; all 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. wide and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>
in. thick. These must all be planed on the one side
and the edges.</p>

<p>The keel should be sawn 11 ft. 3 in. long, <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. wide, and 2 in. deep, and
afterwards planed, the bow end being cut to suit the curve of the bows, and the
stern end to the bend of the stern.</p>

<p>The gunwales are each 12 ft. 6 in. long, and 1 in. square, and are planed on
three sides.</p>

<p>The next process in the building of the boat is characterised by its heat, and,
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
fact, is somewhat similar to working in a vapour bath, for, as each of the ribs and
laths requires to be boiled tender and flexible before it is possible to fix them, the
nature of the work can
better be imagined than
described. <a href="#FigXXIII07">Fig. 7</a>, which
is engraved from a photograph,
will give a general
idea of the position of the
laths and ribs, as well as
of the interior of the boat.</p>

<p>The first three long
laths on either side can be
screwed into their places
without steaming; before
fixing them it is, however, advisable to pencil their places on the bows. The
divisions will be as follows, but it must be remembered that notches are not needed
to be cut in the stern post, as the end of each lath is bevelled off before being
screwed up. Beginning at the top of the stern post, <span class="smcapall">C</span>,
<a href="#FigXXIII02">Fig. 2</a>, we have (1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 2<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>
in., (1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
in., (1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 1<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>
in., (1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 1<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>
in., (1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,) 2<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. lower face of keelson,
and on the other side the same.</p>

<div class="figc600" id="FigXXIII07">
<img src="images/illo270.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="218" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.&mdash;Showing the interior and framework of the boat. The
footboards are removed in order to show keelson.</p>
</div>

<p>The fourth lath of each side need not be steamed, as it is a short one of 6 ft. 3 in.,
reaching only from the notches <span class="smcapall">A</span> of section
<span class="smcapall">I J</span> across the midship section to the
notch <span class="smcapall">A</span> of section <span class="smcapall">G H</span>.</p>

<p>The steaming process of which we now have need can be conducted in a
laundry or washhouse boiler, and consists of boiling the wood until it is quite
soft and flexible, when it can be bent to any desired shape, which it will always
afterwards retain.</p>

<p>The laths (No. 5) will require boiling or steaming, and when perfectly flexible are
to be tied firmly in their places, and screwed up when dry. Nos. 6 and 7 are to be
treated the same, but No. 7 should not go quite to the bow end of the boat, being
cut off and secured about half way between the section <span class="smcapall">G H</span> and the bows. The
stern end also of this lath is to be screwed up to the stern post near the point
marked <i>d</i> on <a href="#FigXXIII02">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p>The laths must be fixed one on each side alternately, or otherwise there is a
danger of warping the boat. When the laths are all firmly screwed up in their
notches the gunwales and ribs must be bent on. The gunwales should be well
steamed, especially the bow ends, and then lashed on to the outside of the two top
laths, but not screwed on yet.</p>

<p>The ribs, of which there are twelve, are of the same strength and material as the
laths, and are placed three in each partition of the boat.</p>

<p>Beginning at the bow end, the first three are cut in half and screwed at equal
distances on each side of the keelson. The three between the section <span class="smcapall">G H</span> and the
amidships, as well as the three between the amidships and section <span class="smcapall">I J</span>, are in single
lengths reaching from the inside of the top lath on the one side, inside the laths and
outside the keelson, or rather sunk <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. into it, and then on top the other side,
keeping inside the laths to the top lath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>A screw is driven through the rib into each lath, and the rib is firmly screwed
to the keelson, the notch above it being afterwards filled up and planed level with
the keelson.</p>

<p>The three ribs at the stern cannot be put in whole, and will require a certain
amount of scheming to make them bend and fit in their proper places. The ends
of the ribs must be cut off level with the top laths. The screws which hold the rib
ends to the top lath are only temporary, for, after the canvas has been stretched on,
and the gunwales screwed into their places they must be removed, and longer and
stronger ones driven through rib, lath, and canvas into the gunwales.</p>

<p>The two rowlocks can be made by a blacksmith, and it would be well if a
rowlock could be borrowed as a pattern from which he can work.</p>

<p>The gunwales must be strengthened to receive the rowlocks at the place <i>k</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>k</i>,
on <a href="#FigXXIII08">Fig. 8</a>, and after the manner shown at <i>k</i>,
<a href="#FigXXIII04">Fig. 4</a>, with oak strips screwed on to
the gunwales, and an iron plate top and bottom, to prevent the holes being worn.
The position of the rowlocks is 18 in. from the centre of the seat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXIII08">
<img src="images/illo271.png" alt="boat" width="600" height="179" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap"><i>Fig. 8. Plan</i></span></p>
</div>

<p>The stem seat will now require attention. It should be placed at about 14 in.
aft of the section <span class="smcapall">I J</span>, and its back should be no nearer the stem than 10 in.; it is
supported on an <span class="smcapall">A</span>-shaped frame, as shown in <a href="#FigXXIII08">Fig. 8</a>, and should be something after
the manner of the one shown in <a href="#FigXXIII07">Figs. 7</a> and <a href="#FigXXIII08">8</a>, though the builder will, of course,
make it according to his own taste for comfort and appearance, but in any case
let it be strong enough.</p>

<p>The rudder should be of the size shown in <a href="#FigXXIII02">Fig. 2</a>, and if sailing is contemplated
two tillers or handles will be necessary, the one for sailing being a plain handle, as
shown in <a href="#FigXXIII01">Figs. 1</a> and <a href="#FigXXIII02">2</a>, and the other with ropes and placed at right angles to the
rudder, as shown in <a href="#FigXXIII07">Figs. 7</a> and <a href="#FigXXIII08">8</a>. Two cleats will be required in sailing, placed
one on either side at about 8 in. aft of the section <span class="smcapall">I J</span>, and of the size and shape
shown at <span class="smcapall">O</span>, <a href="#FigXXIII08">Fig. 8</a>.</p>

<p>The building of the boat will now have occupied about 100 hours, and the
builder may congratulate himself that the greater part of his work is over.</p>

<p>The whole of the woodwork should receive a coat of paint, and be left
to dry thoroughly. The framework of the boat is then ready to receive the canvas,
which in this style of boat answers admirably in the place of boards. The best
material for this purpose is a strong, closely-woven sailcloth; the stuff I used
cost 1s. 1d. per yard square, and 6<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> yards were necessary to cover the boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>The canvas is nailed outside the laths and keelson crossways, or from side to
side; it should be made to fit like a glove, and the seams must be strongly sewn up.
The edges are secured by being screwed up between the top laths and the gunwales,
and all joints between it and woodwork must be smeared with a mixture of red and
white lead before being nailed up. When it is properly fixed in its place, and before
the keel is screwed on, it should be made waterproof. This can be done either
by coating it first with boiled oil and then giving it several coats of paint, or by the
following method, which is taken from the <i>Field</i>, and which I found to answer
admirably. Take 6 oz. yellow soap and dissolve in 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> pints water, and while boiling
add and stir in 5 lb. spruce ochre or other colouring matter, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> lb. patent dryers,
and 5 lb. of boiled linseed oil. This composition is applied with an ordinary paint
brush, and one coat on the inside and three on the outside are sufficient to make
the boat waterproof. Before putting on the last coat of paint, screw on the keel and
caulk the joint with a mixture of red and white lead.</p>

<p>The ribs, etc., can be painted any desired colour, and, if it is wished to finish the
boat off completely, a coat or two of oak varnish can be applied inside and out.</p>

<p>A strip of iron should be screwed all along the keel, to prevent the wood being
damaged.</p>

<p>The mast may be 8 ft. 6 in. long, and 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. thick at the base, tapering upwards.
The sail, which is made of coarse linen costing 5d. per yard, is of the shape shown
in <a href="#FigXXIII01">Fig. 1</a>, and will require 7 yards if the linen is 31 in. wide, or what is in the trade,
I believe, called seven-eighths breadth.</p>

<p>The gaff is 6 ft. long, and 1 in. thick, and should, as well as the mast, be made
of ash.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the sail are as follows. Referring to <a href="#FigXXIII01">Fig. 1</a>, the length of
the bottom is 7 ft.; the side close to the mast, 5 ft. 6 in.; top along the gaff, 5 ft.
9 in.; and the remaining side, 7 ft. 3 in. The edges are sewn around a piece
of rope, and along the upper edge, close to the rope, is a row of eyelet-holes,
through which strong string is passed to lash the sail to the gaff. Two more
rows of eyelet-holes are required, the one 6 in. above the bottom edge, and the
other 6 in. above that again. These are for the purpose of reefing the sail during a
high wind.</p>

<p>A strip of linen should be sewn to the sail along the line of the eyelet-holes, in
order to give the brass eyelets a better grasp. The brass eyelets can be obtained
from any ironmonger at about fourpence per box, and pinchers for closing them can
be borrowed from an ironmonger or a shoemaker.</p>

<p>Of course, ballast will be necessary when sailing, and for this a couple of bags
of sand, equal to a weight of 1 cwt., will suffice.</p>

<p>And now I think that the building of the Swallow is finished, and the builder,
somewhat weary, perchance, after his solitary labour, extending over some two
months, is prepared to enter on the final and pleasanter task of launching his boat.
This he may do with confidence, being certain that it will be quite watertight, very
buoyant, and capable of carrying and seating three with ease.</p>

<p>Let me, before closing, express the hope that the builder will pass as many
pleasant hours in the boat he has built as I have in mine, and then he will have
no cause to regret the time and labour spent in its manufacture.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.&mdash;HOW TO MAKE A CANVAS CANOE.<br />
<span class="smcap">By E. T. Littlewood, M.A.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">I propose to give directions for the construction of a canvas canoe requiring the
expenditure of from 15s. to &pound;1 in money, from a week to a fortnight of spare time,
a very few tools, and a moderate amount of skill.</p>

<p>I have from time to time made canoes of various kinds, and have been led to
adopt the pattern to be hereafter described as being most easily and cheaply
constructed, and as possessing the important characters of speed, comfort, safety,
and durability, and not being too heavy to carry on the shoulder for a quarter of a
mile or so if necessary.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXIV01">
<img src="images/illo273a.png" alt="canoe" width="600" height="113" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<p class="largeillo"><a href="images/illo273alg.png">Fig. 1 enlarged</a> (15 kB)</p>

<p>To proceed at once to my directions. It will be best to build under cover,
though this is not a necessity. For the keel take a piece of straight deal or pine,
free from imperfections, 10 ft. &times; 2 in. &times; 1 in. For stem and stern post, which should
be alike, pieces of oak or elm should be cut to the pattern shown (<a href="#FigXXIV01">Fig. 1</a>) from
a piece with a curved grain (to be had for about 6d.) 1 ft. 6 in. &times; 1 ft. &times; <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.; 3 in.
at the ends should be bevelled off and fitted to the ends of the keel, taking care
that the latter forms one plane with them. They are best fixed in their place by
driving copper nails through, and tapping their ends over perforated caps known as
&#8216;burs,&#8217; which can be easily obtained; but wire nails clenched will do here, as in
other parts of the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<div class="figc600">

<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Next from <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. deal plank cut out two shapes to fit over keel (allowing it to
project <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.), according to patterns
(<a href="#FigXXIV02">Figs. 2</a> and <a href="#FigXXIV03">3</a>). Strips of <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. should be nailed on
each side of the sockets cut for the keel, coming rather nearer at their other ends.
The use of these is both to strengthen the shapes themselves and to make them fit
firmly and tightly to the keel, also to make supports for the coamings round the
well, to be described later.</p>

<img src="images/illo274a.png" alt="canoe" width="600" height="104" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.</p>
</div>

<p>The shapes should be placed with strips turned towards the ends of the canoe
and at right angles to the keel, the larger one 10 in. behind the middle point of the
keel, and the smaller one 2 ft. 10 in. in front of the same point (<a href="#FigXXIV04">Fig. 4</a>). Take care
that the middle points of the shapes are in a straight line with the stem and stern post.
A good nail may now be driven right through the two ends of each pair of strips,
clipping the keel tightly between them. Next take two clean strips of deal rather
longer than the canoe. They should be perfectly free from knots or imperfections,
or much trouble will be occasioned afterwards. Say 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
in. &times; <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. Fit them on as
in <a href="#FigXXIV04">Fig. 4</a>, bevelling off the ends, and nailing into stem and stern post.</p>

<p>They should be allowed to take their natural curve, but pulled lengthways a
little, so as to hold well to the shapes. Both sides should be alike, and the shapes
should not be driven out of the central line. To prevent this, before nailing get a
friend to hold the two ends against the stem while you nail the other ends to the
stern post. Then nail the former ends to the stem, pulling them towards you a
little, and keeping your eye on the central line. They may now be nailed to the
shapes by means of corner pieces.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXIV05">

<p class="caption">Fig. 5.</p>
</div>

<p>Next prepare, or get a carpenter to prepare for you, ten strips a little longer
than the canoe, and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. square. This is a very good thickness. These are to be
arranged as in <a href="#FigXXIV05">Fig. 5</a>, the distances between the strips being equal, or, if anything,
decreasing a little towards the keel, where the pressure of the water will be greatest.
They should be put on in the same way as the upper stronger strips which already
form the gunwale. I may repeat that this thin wood must be thoroughly good. If
any strip is not so, it is useless and must be replaced by another. Cut rests for the
strips in the shapes, allowing them to project a little. Let the strips lie flat to the
edges of the shapes. Do not, however, <i>twist</i> them in fitting their
ends to stem and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
stern post. Those edges of the strips which would press into the canvas must be
planed off. The ends, especially near the keel, will require care in fitting (<a href="#FigXXIV06">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

</div><!--figc600-->

<p>It is better to drive no nails through the strips except at the ends. Those parts
of the shapes which are between the strips should now be hollowed out (<a href="#FigXXIV07">Fig. 7</a>), so
that when the water presses in the canvas no projection shall be produced across the
direction of motion of the canoe, as such projections seriously retard its progress.
All the edges of the strips which would be liable to work through the canvas should
be shaved off as before mentioned.</p>

<p>Next for the coamings round the well in which to sit. This should be made
generally strong. Make a framework of deal 2 in. &times; <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in., to fit in exactly between
the shapes as shown in <a href="#FigXXIV10">Fig. 10</a>. The breadth at the stern end may be 18 in., and at
the other 14 in. This will be quite broad enough. The two end pieces should be
well nailed into those strips by which the shapes were strengthened. Also fit struts
between the middle points of the sides of the well and the gunwale. Fit two strips
about 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. &times; <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>
in., or 2 in. &times; <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in., from the middle point of the top of each shape,
or end of the well, to the stem and stern post, nailing the gunwale at each end into
it through some interposed wedges, so as to make a solid triangle at each end.</p>

</div>

</div><!--figc600-->

<p>In each of the three compartments of the canoe fit a strengthening rib, as shown
in <a href="#FigXXIV08">Fig. 8</a> for middle, <a href="#FigXXIV09">Fig. 9</a> for ends, which will sufficiently explain the construction.
They should be fastened to the gunwale, but the thinner strips had better be
arranged merely to rest against them, and not to be nailed into them. They need
only be made of thin wood. Thin oak would be best.</p>

<p>Put one or two light cross strengtheners between the two sides of the gunwale,
and one or two from the keel to the upper longitudinal pieces. The latter may be
nailed into the cross pieces. Go carefully over the whole framework, removing
any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
eminences or loose nails likely to wear a hole in the canvas, remembering always
that the water will press it well against the framework, and the canoe will be ready
for covering. But the floor should be first put in, which may consist of a piece of
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. plank laid on the keel, strengthened at each end by a cross piece. By means
of the latter it may be nailed into the
shapes, and another piece across the
middle may be added, which will not
interfere with sitting.</p>

<p>The covering is best made of what
is known by linendrapers as &#8216;crash,&#8217;
strong and close. It must be wide enough
to go completely under the canoe, and
can be had about 5 ft. wide, which will
be quite wide enough. Seven yards of
it will be sufficient.</p>

</div>

<p>To put on the canvas, turn the canoe
over. Lay the canvas with the centre line along the keel. Stretch it well by
pulling at each end, and tack it through the middle at the extreme ends with a few
tacks in a temporary manner. Put in temporary tacks along the gunwale at
moderate intervals, stretching slightly, and endeavour to get rid of all folds. Begin
in the middle and work towards the ends, and always pull straight away from the
keel, and not along the gunwale. Then
put in a second set of tacks half way
between the first set of tacks on one
side, pulling fairly tightly. Then on the
other side put in tacks opposite to the
latter, pulling as tightly as possible. The best way to do this is to seize the canvas
with a pair of pincers, so that on pulling you can get the head of the pincers
just over the gunwale, when they can be used as a lever to give an extra pull. A
tack may then be put in on the outside of the gunwale. Half-inch galvanised tacks
will do. Now remove the temporary set of tacks. To get rid of folds, which will
not occur along the keel, but along the gunwale,
keep bisecting the distance between two consecutive
tacks by another tack, so that the canvas is equally
loose on each side of it, always now pulling the
canvas as tightly as possible. In this way the folds
will disappear, and the canvas be stretched tight and
well fastened to the gunwale. Leave that portion
within a foot of each end untacked. Next cut away
all that portion which projects beyond the stem
and stern post, turn the edges in, and tack along
the edges at moderate distances. Bisect these
distances, and these again, till you have a very close row of tacks, as in <a href="#FigXXIV12">Fig. 12</a>.
Pull fairly tight, but not too tight, and do not use pincers for this part. Quarter-inch
tacks will be best. The ends may be cut out and put on, lapping the edges
over the side, as shown in <a href="#FigXXIV12">Fig. 12</a>, and enough canvas
will be left to fill the part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
along the sides of the well, into which the canvas should be tacked with a fine row
of tacks, afterwards being stretched over the gunwale. The canoe will now be
completely covered in except the well. Before putting on the top, however, give
the lower part outside a good coating of boiled linseed oil. This will be most of
it absorbed into the canvas. The same may be done afterwards with the top.
When this is dry&mdash;that is, after two or three days&mdash;give another good coating of the
same. Then paint the canoe according to taste. Two coats for the bottom will
be advisable, and paint which will stand water well should be used. It would be
well to paint the framework with one coat before covering.</p>

<p>Make a stretcher (<a href="#FigXXIV13">Fig. 13</a>) for the feet of
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. board, and slips to fit it into (<a href="#FigXXIV10">Fig.

to correspond (<a href="#FigXXIV14">Fig. 14</a>). Each piece in the latter may be
18 in. &times; 4 in. They should be nailed into two cross-pieces
behind, so as to form a hollow for back, and should be placed
2 in. apart, to allow a space for the spine. I prefer myself to fit
in the backboard by means of stops on the floor and back of
the well, making it keep one position, and that at a considerable
slope, and have not found a swinging backboard so comfortable as
some appear to have done.</p>

</div>

<p>For the paddle, for which I think about 7 ft. 6 in. long over all is a
good length, take a light, clean piece of yellow pine or fir
1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.,
not more, and 6 ft. long. In the ends of this cut slots 6 in. long, each
to receive two pear-shaped pieces of very light <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. plank 1 ft. 3 in. &times; 8 in.
Nail them through with copper nails if possible. The blades should
be at right angles to the thickest direction of the handle. Before
nailing-in shave down the handle from an oval of 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. for
2 ft. of the middle to an oval of about 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>
in. &times; <sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. near the beginning
of the blades. The handle should have its full thickness at the beginning of
the blade but should be well tapered off along the blade, so as to be quite thin at
its middle, where it ends. It should have
its full breadth across the breadth of the
blade. The blade itself may be shaved
off thinner towards the edges. I do not
think that for ordinary purposes any strip
of copper or tin need be put round the
blade, and the weight is increased by
using it. The great thing about a paddle
is that it should be as light as possible, and, if it appears able to stand it, it may
be reduced still further. It may be painted or varnished, all but two feet in the
middle. I find no rings on the paddles necessary.</p>

<p>A short strip nailed outside the gunwale in the middle of the canoe is a good
thing; it prevents wear from the paddle, and forms something to catch hold of in
lifting the canoe. A short outer keel is also a good thing at each end to prevent
wear; but in making holes for the nails through the canvas into the keel care must
be taken to turn in the edges round each hole, to tack with a close circle of tacks,
and paint well, so as to render the place watertight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>An apron is seldom wanted, but may be made of canvas rendered waterproof
with boiled oil if desired. It is well to fasten some inflated bladders in each end, so
as to make the canoe a diminutive lifeboat, in case of an upset or of a hole being
knocked in her.</p>

<p>The canoe will now be ready for launching. The owner should learn to put
her carefully into the water and take her out by himself&mdash;to carry her on his
shoulder. Superfluous wood may be cut from the central parts of the shapes, and
also from along the keel towards the ends before covering. The floor forms a
considerable item in the weight, consequently this should be made no wider or
thicker than necessary. In paddling, learn to reach well forward and back, with a
good swing of the body from side to side.</p>

<p>Such a canoe as described will be found to wear well, and one made by myself
for a friend two years ago is now in use, and quite watertight.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV.&mdash;CANADIAN, INDIAN, BIRCH-BARK AND OTHER
LIGHT CANOES.<br />
<span class="smcap">By C. Stansfeld-Hicks.</span></h3>

<h4>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Canadian and Birch-Bark Canoes.</span></h4>

<p class="noindent">The most convenient size to make will probably be that of a canoe now in my possession,
17 ft. long, 27 in. wide, and 1 ft. deep. She is built as follows.</p>

<p>Two strong pieces of tough wood, forming together something the shape of a
snowshoe, as <a href="#FigXXV01">Fig. 1</a>, and lashed strongly together at the ends, form the gunwale.
The ribs are of thin stuff about one-eighth of an inch thick, and two to three inches
wide, running from gunwale to gunwale in one piece, the ends slightly pointed so as
(<a href="#FigXXV03">Fig. 3</a>) to fit into notches cut in the under side of the gunwale. Between these
ribs and the outer skin is placed some kind of thin bark pitched over, and the outer
skin is composed of birch bark.</p>

<div class="figc520">

<div class="figleft" id="FigXXV01">
<img src="images/illo279a.png" alt="canoe" width="280" height="150" />

<img src="images/illo279c.png" alt="canoe" width="168" height="200" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>At each end, at the dotted line <span class="smcapall">A A</span> (<a href="#FigXXV02">Fig. 2</a>), there is a strong apron-piece,
but the bows are simply sewn together, as are the other joints in the boat, which is
very light and handy. Now the thing is for you who have no birch bark to build a
canoe on the same principle, easily and at little cost, and we will consider how this
is to be done.</p>

<p>In an American paper there once appeared an article on &#8216;A Paper Boat,&#8217;
built on the lines of a birch-bark canoe, and it is not long since an adventurous
young American went a tremendous distance on the American rivers in a paper
canoe of his own construction. So you have paper proved to be possible as
a skin for your boat as a substitute for birch bark. Another substitute and a far
stronger one is canvas.</p>

<p>We will now proceed to get out the framework of the boat in question.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXV04">
<img src="images/illo280a.jpg" alt="canoe" width="550" height="378" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.</p>
</div>

<p>In the diagram (<a href="#FigXXV04">Fig. 4</a>) you have sheer plan, body and deck plan, of a modified
Canadian canoe; the ends are less curved than the original, but otherwise it is
much the same. The first thing you will have to do is to draw a plan to scale
on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
this principle of the canoe you propose building, and the simplest scale you can
use is that of one inch to a foot, and in this way, if you decide on a canoe fifteen
feet by two feet by one foot,
the plan on paper will be
fifteen inches by two inches
by one inch, which you can
multiply by twelve to get your
measurements for any part.</p>

<p>You must first get a piece
of wood for the keel. These
canoes are always built without
any exterior keel, and are
therefore easily turned and
managed; at the same time
they are as easily turned by
the wind, if there should be
any, and for rough water I
should prefer giving a small
exterior keel screwed on to
the keel on which you build
the canoe, and which forms part of the body of the boat itself; but this you must
decide for yourself. If you only want to punt about in smooth water and in
shallows, you can dispense with any exterior keel, and in any case you can easily
screw on a false keel of whatever depth you consider necessary afterwards.</p>

<p>The keel proper had best be shaped broad in the middle&mdash;say, six inches&mdash;and
tapering off to the ends where the stem and stern posts are joined on. Having
got your keel ready, and the stem and stern posts kneed in, and ascertained by a
plumb line that they are perpendicular to the keel, the next thing is to cut out
shadows, or frames, from the body plan. Three of these shadows will do (see <a href="#FigXXV04">Fig.
4</a>, <span class="smcapall">C C C</span>), one amidships, and one each between midships and the stem and stern.
These shadows must be secured to the keel in such a way that they will not shift
from the perpendicular, to which you must plumb them. The keel can be made
of any good wood, elm or oak for preference; but common deal will do very
well. It should be three-quarters of an inch by six inches in the middle, and taper
to the ends. The stem and stern posts can be of three-quarter inch deal or hard
wood, of sufficient length, and two to four inches deep, shaped out and secured with
a galvanised iron or wooden knee to the keel. You can use
an apron-piece or not, as you prefer. If you elect to dispense
with the apron-piece the stem and stern posts must be
deeper than if you use it, and a light groove of, say, one-eighth
of an inch cut to receive the ends of the stringers. (See
<a href="#FigXXV05">Fig. 5</a>, <span class="smcapall">A A A A</span>.) Or this groove can be dispensed with, and
the end of the stringer tapered off so as to come flush.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXV05">
<img src="images/illo280b.png" alt="canoe" width="250" height="159" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 5.</p>
</div>

<p>You will now want two to three stringers each side, of elm,
ash or other tough wood, of sufficient length, and about half an inch thick by one
inch wide. These will run from stem to stern over the shadows, and be
firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
secured to the parts. The gunwale must be of the same sort of wood, say one
inch square, and let in half an inch into the shadows to bring it flush with the
stringers. The gunwale must be secured to the stem and stern posts, leaving about
an inch of the posts above it; and a triangular piece of hard wood an inch thick
and about three to six inches deep must be shaped to fit between the gunwales
and the stem and stern posts, and the gunwales firmly secured to it by countersunk
screws. This will bind all firmly together. As you will have taken the measurements
from your plans, in which you have decided the sheer of the boat, the
gunwale will follow this sheer, starting from the midship shadow and curving up
towards the posts.</p>

<p>You have now got the framework ready, with the exception of the ribs, which are
put in afterwards. The next step will be to get the canvas to form the outside skin.</p>

<p>You must buy sufficient canvas to cover your canoe. See that it is close and
strong (No. 6, Navy unbleached, or something as near that as possible). Turn the
canoe upside down, and stretch your canvas over it, tacking it firmly along the keel
with copper nails about an inch apart, and then strain it tightly to the gunwales and
secure it there with copper tacks (iron or large tin tacks may be used here if you are
short of copper), first turning down the raw edge of the canvas. Then tack
down the ends to the stem and stern posts, lapping one side of the canvas first
round the opposite side of the part and securing it, and then bringing the other side
of the canvas over the part secured and tacking it on the opposite side, thus doubling
the canvas over the stem and stern posts. It is as well to run a copper band from
six inches down the stem and stern posts to about a foot along the keel, to take the
wear off the canvas, and a slight wooden false keel may be screwed over all with
brass screws, or fastened with copper nails. Any slackness that may exist in the
canvas must now be taken up. Turn the canoe right side up and gather in the
canvas where you can find it slack, which will probably be at the bow and stern; and,
after gathering it tightly in a pleat, sew it strongly down on the inside. This,
perhaps, had best be done before you completely secure the canvas down, and
while it is only secured at the ends and along the gunwale, leaving it unfastened
along the keel.</p>

<p>Next get your ribs ready; these had best be made of rock elm or other tough
wood, to avoid the trouble of steaming. They must be about three-sixteenths of an
inch by three-quarters wide, or one inch or even two inches wide will do if you can
bend them. Space the ribs about six inches apart; you can put them closer if you
want extra strength. See that they are cut the right length, that when put in&mdash;which
must be done by main force&mdash;the ribs take all the stringers, and butt tightly
under the gunwales. You may either cut a slight notch in the gunwale to receive
the ends of the ribs, or, after all the ribs are in, run a strip of wood half an inch
by half an inch under the gunwale and over all the ribs, screwing it firmly to the
gunwale, to keep the ribs in their places. When the ribs are all in their places, you
may remove the shadows and look over the canvas again to see if it is all tight,
putting an extra rib in wherever you have taken it up, and securing such a plain
to the rib by a few tacks.</p>

<p>You must now cut the crossbars the proper size and fit them in, securing them
to the gunwale by knees on each side. You have now only to paint the
canvas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and when it has had two or three coats, firmly dried on, the canoe is ready to use.
After using it turn it upside down, so that water cannot accumulate inside, as if it
does it will soon rot the canvas, and whenever the paint wears off a little be careful
to replace it. With these simple precautions such a canoe will last a long while,
and will be of great use and amusement to you, as it can be easily carried from one
piece of water to another by one person. Should you wish to make it a lifeboat,
all you have to do is to get two zinc cases fitted to each end, which will float the
canoe if capsized, or run a tapering belt of painted canvas filled with corks round
the canoe outside on the water-line (see <a href="#FigXXV05">Fig. 5</a>, <span class="smcapall">A A A A A</span>). If you take this
precaution you will probably not
regret it, as a capsize is a very
simple matter to achieve in any
round-bottomed light boat, and
there is not much stuff in such
a slightly-constructed craft to
float the occupant if capsized.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXV06">
<img src="images/illo282a.jpg" alt="canoe" width="500" height="321" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 6.</p>
</div>

<p>The American paper canoe
was constructed something in
the same way as to framework,
but two of the shadows were left
in after being cut away in the
middle (see <a href="#FigXXV06">Fig. 6</a>), leaving them
three or four inches deep all
round, and the keel was left
about one foot wide between the
two shadows, which were placed
so as to divide the keel into three equal parts. They were firmly screwed to the keel,
stringers (<span class="smcapall">B B</span>) were then run from stem to stern. The stem and stern posts
were of green elm screwed to the bottom board or keel, and bent (see <a href="#FigXXV06">cut</a>) into the
required position; the ribs were made of osier willow switches put in while green;
the gunwale (<span class="smcapall">A A</span>) was of ash. This
framework was covered with very
strong wrapping-paper, smooth
and very tough, neither stiff nor
very thick. This was secured
first to the bottom board, the
canoe being turned upside down;
and then the paper was trimmed
into shape and brought up to the
gunwales, and secured there by
being turned in over the gunwale
and held down by long strips of
ash or cane. The whole outside surface of the paper was then given three coats
of varnish (<a href="#FigXXV07">Fig. 7</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXV07">
<img src="images/illo282b.jpg" alt="canoe" width="500" height="228" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.</p>
</div>

<p>The constructor, however, found that the boat leaked, and he then covered it
with unbleached muslin strained outside over the paper, tacked along the
gunwales,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
and sewn at the ends; it was then tightened by shrinking, and received three coats
of a mixture of varnish and paint; this appears to have stopped the leaking entirely,
and the owner then enjoyed a great deal of cruising and paddling in his paper boat.</p>

<p>After using it some time he discarded the &#8216;paddle proper,&#8217; and fitted a pair of
iron rowlocks sufficiently long to be secured to the bottom board and the gunwales,
and used a pair of short sculls.</p>

<h4>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Paper and other Typical Canoes.</span></h4>

<p>It must entirely depend on the surroundings of the maker as to what materials he
had best use. If a lad has the ability to build a canoe at all, he must be the best
judge of the easiest way for him to set about it, and it is impossible to lay down
hard-and-fast rules as to what he shall use in its construction. All he requires is the
general idea which is given here, and where a lad with every convenience and a
long purse will use the best materials another, under different circumstances and
perhaps far away from opportunities of getting the most suitable timber, etc., for his
purpose, will have to exercise his ingenuity and bring into use those materials he is
limited to. So, perhaps, in some instances where thick and good canvas cannot be
got, a serviceable boat can be made of a thinner and cheaper material, such as
unbleached calico put on over a skin of old newspapers pasted together to form a
backing; and such a covering thoroughly varnished with several coats, or if that is
too costly well painted inside and outside with a mixture of tar and pitch boiled
together, half and half, would give a great deal of amusement to its owner, and cost a
mere trifle. Of course, it would not look so well. The best backing to use under
thin canvas or calico would be good paper, prepared in this way:&mdash;take a large sheet
of good strong paper, brown preferably, and cover it with a coating of marine glue;
place another piece of paper over it to cover the glue, and take a flat-iron, warm,
but not too hot; thoroughly iron the top paper till the glue comes out through the
pores of the paper; the two sheets will then be firmly held together by the waterproof
glue, and any size can be prepared in this way, making a first-class stiffening
inside skin, which can be covered outside with thin calico, painted and varnished.</p>

<p>The paddles used with these canoes are single-bladed. The stern paddle,
which is used to steer as well as propel the canoe, is considerably larger than the
bow paddle. The lengths of the paddles are&mdash;stern, five feet; bow, four feet;
breadth of blade at broadest part&mdash;stern, six inches; bow, five inches; length of
blade of paddle, two feet. The handle may be about three-quarters
of an inch to one inch in diameter, but much thicker at
the extreme end, where some of the paddles now used are
shaped like <a href="#FigXXV08">Fig. 8</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXV08">
<img src="images/illo283.png" alt="canoe" width="200" height="208" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 8.</p>
</div>

<p>The paddle is used as follows. You will readily understand
that a stroke of a paddle used only on one side would cause the
boat or canoe so propelled to turn its bow in the opposite
direction; to meet this, before the paddle is withdrawn from the
water, it must be slightly feathered and the handle brought
inwards, the middle of the paddle resting on the gunwale of the
canoe, the blade thus bringing the bow round and steering the canoe in a straight
course. The pressure used must be merely adequate to bring the canoe
straight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
and will depend on the amount of sheer she has taken. If this is properly done,
which requires some practice, it will not at all interfere with the forward propulsion
of the canoe. The handle of the paddle is left rather wide at the end to allow of
an easy grasp, and the
other hand holds the paddle
not quite half way down.</p>

<p>In stalking game the
Indians never withdraw the
paddle from the water at
all, but feather under water
without making the slightest
noise and scarcely
causing a ripple.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 9.&mdash;Irish Curragh.</p>
</div>

<p>Another description of
boat made of canvas is the
Irish Curragh (<a href="#FigXXV09">Fig. 9</a>), used
principally in the south-west
of Ireland. Some of
these boats are of considerable
size&mdash;I have seen one
twenty-six feet by four feet
beam&mdash;and are used in the
heaviest weather and the
roughest seas, and from
their extreme lightness are
wonderfully good sea boats,
the peculiar construction
of the bow, which rises
very much, lifting the boat
over the seas. They have
a strong frame made of
ribs with stringers spaced
only about three inches
apart. The stringers run
the whole length of the
boat, which is something
of the shape of half a barrel
greatly elongated. They
are simply and easily constructed,
and are covered
with common canvas.
Several coatings of a preparation
of tar are given to
the canvas, converting it into a species of tarpaulin, and as the interior framework
is very close it is impossible to stand or press in any way on the canvas skin,
which is thus kept from injury from that source. The curragh is propelled
by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
paddles used as sculls, and a large one has six men, each pulling two paddles.
They have no rowlocks, but an iron pin stands up from the gunwale, and a chock
is fixed to the paddle
with a hole to fit the
iron pin. In this way
the paddles can be
left without being unshipped
if necessary,
and fall alongside the
boat with no chance
of being lost.</p>

<p>The <a href="#FigXXV17">coracle</a> used
for fishing in Ireland
and in Wales is merely a
framework, sometimes
of wicker and sometimes
of wood, somewhat
in the shape of the
half of a walnut-shell.
They are generally
covered with leather,
and are extremely light.</p>

<p>Since writing the
above I have seen
a paper which, to
those who can afford
the price, is the very
thing to employ in
building a canoe or
small boat. I allude
to the Willesden paper,
invented by the late
Dr. Scoffern. This
paper is thoroughly
water-proof, and is
manufactured in all
thicknesses. The best
for the purpose is about
one-eighth of an inch
thick. It runs in sufficient
length to build
an ordinary canoe in
one piece, and the
width, being fifty-three inches, is amply sufficient. The price is five shillings per
yard run, which, for a canoe say fifteen feet long, would be twenty-five shillings,
and would be the principal part of the cost. This paper will not only make
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
strong and safe boat, but also a very handsome and fast one, as, being in one
piece, there is no joining or unevenness, but one perfectly smooth surface, offering
little resistance to the water. For the purpose of building models it would be
hard to find a better substitute
for wood, and in
most cases it would be found
far cheaper.</p>

<p>The Canadian batteau
(<a href="#FigXXV10">Fig. 10</a>) is a class of boat
that is very easily constructed
in paper, canvas, or
wood, and you will see from
the plan how it is made.
It differs from the preceding

the American
paper canoe approaching
it most nearly in shape,
though in the batteau the flat bottom is wider, and the sides are also flat, flaring
out a good deal.</p>

<p>I also give sketches of other types of crafts. And now for a parting word of
advice: whatever type of canoe you select, I hope you will be able to produce one
that will pass the examination when your parents and others hold a survey; and
in view of this do your work well and carefully, or you had better leave it alone.
In any case, do not canoe unless you can swim. A canoeist, particularly when
racing, thinks nothing of an upset, which to an accomplished hand is merely the loss
of a few minutes, when, the canoe righted and the owner once more in charge, the
prize is still held in view. This, to a non-swimmer, might mean, however, loss of
life. Speaking from my own experience, I can assure you that I should not now
be writing this if I had been unable to swim, and in no case should canoeing or
boating be indulged in by those who have not mastered that necessary and simple
art. To the swimmer an upset is in most instances simply an annoyance, but to
a non-swimmer it may mean a fatal accident.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.&mdash;HOW TO BUILD A PUNT.<br />
<span class="smcap">By the Rev. Harry Jones, M.A.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">Some years ago I wanted a cheap, strong punt for use in a large pond of some ten
or twelve acres, and went to two or three regular boat-builders to ask the price of
such an article. It varied from some sixteen shillings to a pound per foot. Now,
as I needed something long enough to be rowed, or bear propulsion, with some
steadiness, of course, and, moreover, to carry a good load, I perceived that nothing
much less in length than about sixteen feet would answer my purpose.</p>

<p>The cost of this amounted to more than I was inclined to pay to a professed
boat-builder, and so I put on my considering cap to see whether I could not escape
the charges of an expert and yet realise my punt.</p>

<p>I determined to employ an intelligent country carpenter, who had never been
in a shipyard in his life, and who, being wholly unacquainted with the structure of a
boat, would be likely to follow out my directions without any bias of his own, yet
take the whole credit of the result to himself.</p>

<p>We fixed on deal&mdash;good red, not white deal&mdash;for the wood of our boat, though
my carpenter agreed with me that elm would have been better and teak best, for
this latter does not split in the sun. Elm, however, is generally cut into lengths of
only 12 ft. or 13 ft., which allows for the measure of two coffins, which are mostly
made of this tree. Teak my friend had never seen. The worst of this is its
original cost, and also, when a boat has to be built for inland waters, the expense
of its carriage by rail from the neighbourhood of some coast ship-yard.</p>

<p>We settled on the red deal harmoniously. First we got four planks of 11-in.
deal 12 ft. long and 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. thick. I had it of this thickness to ensure comparative
immunity from splitting when the sides should be nailed on, for these were to form
the floor or bottom of our punt. When planed on both sides, this thickness was of
course reduced. The edges of the planks were &#8216;shot,&#8217; and made to fit as for a glue
joint. After being cramped together they were kept in position by nailing on
transverse pieces 1 in. thick and 4 in. wide, these transverse pieces not reaching
quite to the whole width of the floor. This, the floor, we narrowed, from the centre
towards the ends, until the result was something like a gigantic &#8216;sole&#8217; with its head
and tail cut off square. This raft was our bottom or floor, four planks wide in the
middle, and three planks wide at each end.</p>

<p>I wanted my boat to have not exactly a flat bottom, but one that should rise, or
&#8216;spring,&#8217; some two inches fore and aft. This gives a punt more buoyancy in
rowing, and also enables it to be run aground easily, and to be pushed off without
&#8216;sucking.&#8217; A perfectly flat-bottomed punt sticks or clings to a shallow, muddy
shore. If it is slightly curved, it is shoved off without any difficulty. The question
was how to curve it.</p>

<p>We built our punt in a barn, with crossbeams overhead. First I got
two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
trestles, rather narrower than the ends of the bottom, and rested its ends upon
them, there being some three or four inches to spare between the trestles and the
ends of the bottom. It stood quite flat and stiff. You could not bend it with any
pressure from the hand. I then measured the distance between its surface and a
beam under which its centre stood at right angles, and found it to be exactly 11 ft.
I next cut a length off a young fir-tree, which lay by our saw-pit, 11 ft. 2 in. in
length, and requested our carpenter to set it upright on the middle of the punt floor,
under the beam. Of course he could not. It was 2 in. too long. Then I got him
and his assistant to stand on the bottom of the punt, whose ends just rested on the
trestles, with three or four inches to spare, and to see if the tree would not then
stand under the beam. It did easily. Then he and his assistant stepped off, and,
lo! the punt floor, in trying to recover its flatness, was rigidly fixed, with a &#8216;spring&#8217;
or curve, fore and aft, of 2 in.</p>

<p>The fabric, so far, was steadied for further operations. Then I took two clean
9-in. planks, 1 in. thick, planed on both sides, and, keeping them duly apart with
boards set edgewise the width of the punt bottom, nailed them to the sides. They
bent quite easily, without any assistance from heat, and at once we had the two sides
of our punt. I had these sides considerably longer than the bottom, in order that
the punt might have projecting ends, and so be more easily stepped into from the
shore when run up &#8216;end on.&#8217; Then we got two pieces of wide elm plank for the two
ends of our punt. These were the whole width of the end of the floor, and sloped
out fore and aft. To these we nailed the ends of our sides, and the result was at
once a very shipshape punt, but without any knees or thwarts. These we put in
afterwards, as is usual in boat-building.</p>

<p>But the sides, though high enough to make a punt capable of carrying a
considerable load, were too low to carry rowlocks unless the rower sat on the
bottom of the boat. Thus we put on one other plank on each side 9 in. deep and
1 in. thick. It overlapped the other 2 in., and was long enough to continue the
projection of the ends. It fitted very closely. We nailed these two side planks on
with long copper nails, and put in other pieces of elm for the ends. Outside the
top of these second planks we also nailed a strip 2 in. deep and 1 in. thick. This
made the gunwale of the punt nearly 2 in. wide, and capable of receiving thowls, or
pins.</p>

<p>The seats, or thwarts, we rested on the top of the lower side planks. This gave
a seat of about 7 in. high for the rower, and sufficient height for the bed of the rowlock
above the level of the rower&#8217;s seat, namely 7 in., which is about the usual rule.
We strengthened the thwarts with oak knees against the upper side planks. This,
moreover, gave great rigidity to the whole fabric of the punt. We also used oak
knees or angles, called, in boat-building language, &#8216;hooks,&#8217; at the four corners of
the gunwale, nailing them in horizontally, and thus much tightening the punt at each
corner.</p>

<p>The disposition of the thwarts in such a boat is matter of much importance.
They should be at the proper distance from the rowlocks, and the rower should not
take up too much of the available space in the punt. We arranged ours thus, and
they answered admirably. The floor, be it remembered, was 12 ft. long. We
&#8216;middled&#8217; this, and set the centres of the two thwarts 18 in. from this line.
This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
gave 3 ft. as the distance between the centres of the two thwarts, and their position
in the boat was such that one rower by himself sat just where his weight should be;
so did two, and both sat well away from any &#8216;sitter&#8217; in the end of the boat. The
distance of 3 ft. between the centre of the thwarts enables the rowlocks to be
correctly placed. They should come exactly halfway between the thwarts. By
having three rowlocks on each side, equidistant, the rower or rowers had only to
turn round and row in the opposite direction, the boat having stem and stern alike.
This is convenient under some circumstances, as when there is not room to pull the
boat itself round. The thwarts themselves should be 9 in. wide, and two boards of
the same width at each end, resting on the top of the lower side planks, make
sufficient accommodation for sitters, who, by the arrangement of thwarts and rowlocks
which I have described, are well out of reach of the rower&#8217;s legs in a punt of
the size we made. Altogether the result was excellent. The boat rowed with much
lightness and ease, and would carry four or five adults. It was, moreover, very stiff
in the water. There was no fear of it turning over when rowers shifted places. It
ran far up on shore, so that ladies could step in and out dry-shod.</p>

<p>I should say that we made the ends project about 18 in. fore and aft, while the
floor of the punt was 12 ft. long. Thus our length over all was 15 ft. If I built
another I think I should make each of the ends project 2 ft., and curve the gunwale
a little, giving it a drop of an inch or two in the middle. This gives an agreeable
curve, and takes off the severe straightness of the upper line, which I must confess
rather marred the &#8216;elegance&#8217; of our punt as she lay on the water. A very little
curve or wave-line produces the desired effect.</p>

<p>The cost of building our punt was not very much. I have before me the bill of
the carpenter for wood, time, and some of the nails. It is &pound;6 5s., and he was
longer over it than he would have been had it not been his first attempt. Besides
this, I had to buy the rest of the nails. Ours were mostly zinc, but on another
occasion I should use only copper. The additional expenses were the oak knees
for strengthening the boat, and the varnish with which we &#8216;dressed&#8217; her. We used
no paint, and only two or three places in the seams outside were &#8216;caulked&#8217; with a
little oakum.</p>

<p>I would advise the builder of such a punt, when not able to do the work himself,
to employ an intelligent <i>carpenter</i> who makes his joints close. The whole cost, all
expenses included, was between &pound;7 and &pound;8&mdash;the larger proportion being for
labour, which sharp boys might themselves supply&mdash;and the fabric certainly seems
as if it would last well. It has now passed its second year of service, and is as tight
as a bottle, though it has been somewhat roughly used. For such a punt I should
have had to pay at a boat-builders some &pound;15, and I do not see why one built as I
have advised should not be as strong and serviceable as any could be. The only
point is that I would advise copper rivets, and not zinc, to be used throughout.</p>

<p>Of course, the expense might be lessened by using thinner wood, and therefore
less heavy copper rivets. It is indeed a disputed question whether copper or iron
nails and rivets should be used for fresh-water boats. Many Thames watermen
prefer iron. This would, of course, make the cost of the punt less. I had our sides
one inch thick, in order that the boat might stand very heavy work, and in case of
cracking from extreme heat, might be cured without danger of battering the
sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
in by caulking them, and
without the necessity of
patching them. I should
add that we strengthened
the ends with stout oak
stem and stern posts
nailed or riveted up the
centre of the ends inside.
They should be about 2
in. square. Into these
we drove staples, to
which a rope could be
fastened.</p>

<p>I should, moreover,
advise iron pins instead
of, or as well as, ordinary
thowls. We had them
as well as thowls, there
being halfway between
each thowl-hole a hole
for an iron pin half an
inch thick. Then, if we
wished to use thowls, we took the pins out, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. The advantage of pins
which run
through the oar
in places where
the punt is used
for fishing is,
that the oars
may be left on
the pins without
risk of slipping
overboard.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.&mdash;RAFTS AND CATAMARANS, AND HOW TO
MAKE THEM.<br />
<span class="smcap">By W. J. Gordon and W. L. Alden.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">Over twenty years ago the Fairlie foundered in the Indian Ocean. Spars had been
thrown overboard to form a raft, yet before anything but the skeleton of the framework
could be lashed together the ship went down. The crew jumped into the
square, scrambled on to the boundary spars, and remained astride them with their
legs in the sea until they were rescued a day or two afterwards.</p>

<p>This is as simple a raft as any recorded in shipwreck annals. But what is a raft?
It is indeed a difficult thing to define. Rafts are of all shapes and sizes, varying
from the few booms of the Fairlie up to the elaborate raft of the Medusa, of which
the model was shown in the London Fisheries Exhibition. A raft would seem to be
any floating substance on which a man can sit or stand. Boys have paddled in a
pond on rafts of a couple of planks, soldiers have crossed rivers on rafts of barn-doors,
and we hear of armies using rafts of house-roofs, and wooden-shed walls, and casks
and inflated skins, and pontoons of all shapes, of tin, zinc, copper, iron, leather, wood,
and canvas.</p>

<p>Perhaps the simplest kind of river raft is that common in South Africa, where a
stack of reeds some fifty feet in diameter is pushed into the water and allowed to
float down stream, each day, as the under stems get waterlogged, more being cut
from the banks and thrown on to the heap. A similar rough raft is not uncommon
amongst us in winter, when the ice is very thin, for if a heap of reeds is then thrown
on to a slab of ice, and well watered, a solid mass can be built up with alternate
layers of reeds and ice which will float considerable weights. Besides the floating
stack there is another reed raft in use amongst the Kaffirs, made of a mattress of
reeds about four feet long, three feet broad, and eight inches thick, tied together
with strips of the reeds themselves, with reed posts and railing round.</p>

<p>Skins stretched and inflated are in use all over the globe for raft purposes. In
Peru a hide pinched up at the corners, secured there with a thorn, and dried in the
sun, furnishes the only boat. In another American form we have holes bored all
round the edge, a thong run through them and pulled tight over a framework of
withies,&mdash;in fact, a coracle such as the Celts were so fond of, the washing basket
with the waterproof covering which exists on the coast of Ireland to this day.</p>

<p>The contracting force exercised by skins as they dry has a great deal to do with
the water-tight qualities of hide boats, as, in all cases, the framework is covered as
soon as possible after the death of the animal.</p>

<p>It is astonishing what simple things have been made into boats. Admiral
Fitzroy once sent a party of sailors ashore, and while they were encamped their
boat was stolen. Out of the boughs of the trees around them they made a large
basket, covered it with their canvas tent, puddled the inside with a little clay,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
put to sea, spending eighteen hours in this crazy contrivance before they got back to
safety.</p>

<p>Alexander&#8217;s army passed the Indus, as Hannibal&#8217;s did the Rhine, on rafts made
of inflated skins, or of skins stuffed with hay. On the Tigris and elsewhere at this
very day such goat-skin rafts are still in use. The skins are lashed to a framework
with one of the legs of each animal upwards; through this leg the air is driven in,
and, as the traveller journeys down the stream, he visits the skins in succession and
blows in fresh air to make up for what has escaped. A single ox-hide when inflated
is said to make a float capable of sustaining three hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Casks are almost invaluable in raft-making, and many a shipwrecked crew has
been saved on a platform lashed to floating barrels. One of the early lifeboats
simply consisted of a boat with holes bored in her bottom and empty casks lashed
inside her, the casks giving the floating power while the shape of the boat was
retained. Four spars lashed together with a cask at each corner and a square of
canvas fixed on them was all that one of the patent life-rafts consisted of.</p>

<p>Casks furnish great floating power in such a convenient form that it is hardly to
be wondered at that they have been used over and over again in the construction of
military bridges where boats have been unattainable. They are, however, but a
makeshift, pontoons nowadays being always carried. When Darius crossed the
Bosphorus and afterwards the Danube he did it on a bridge of boats oft very elaborate
construction. When Xerxes crossed the Hellespont he had two bridges, one
consisting of three hundred and sixty vessels anchored side by side and head to
stern, and another, nearer the Archipelago, of three hundred and fourteen vessels
similarly anchored. These were connected by cables, a platform of planks was laid
stretching from each to each, and on the platform from shore to shore there was
laid a thick bed of earth to form the road on which the Persian hosts passed into
Europe. At Xenophon&#8217;s passage of the Tigris thirty-seven vessels were used.</p>

<p>The most famous boat-bridge in modern times was that thrown by the British
over the Adour when Wellington invaded France. The bridge was 810 feet long,
and was at first supported on hawsers, which were kept tight by capstans placed in
the centre of each of the thirty to forty-ton chassemar&eacute;es which formed the piers.
These chassemar&eacute;es were moored side by side at a distance of forty feet from each
other&#8217;s centres, so that the intervals were equal. The platform was after a day or
two shifted on to balks. To protect the bridge a boom was thrown across the river
on each side of it. The best of the raft-bridges was Sokolniki&#8217;s over the Niemen at
Grodno in 1792. The trunks, fifty to sixty feet long and about two feet in diameter,
were lashed together in tens and joined end to end until they reached across the
stream. The bridge was three hundred and sixty yards in length, and formed a
great curve towards the current, with the centre of the curve supported by an
anchored vessel. These trunks were lashed together. A better plan, however, is
that adopted by the Canadian timber-men, who cross-lay their rafts, bore an auger-hole
at the corners through both thicknesses, and fix a wedge in the cleft end of the
stick which keeps them together. As the stick is driven home the wedge is forced
upwards into the end and makes all fast.</p>

<p>On the coast of India it is a very common thing to see two or three natives
afloat on a raft made of three logs of wood&mdash;of the pine varnish-tree&mdash;the
centre log<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
being about five-and-twenty feet long and the breadth of the three together about a
yard. These rafts are man&#339;uvred with very great dexterity, and safely brave the
roughest seas. Similar to them is the Brazilian catamaran, which carries a large
triangular sail.</p>

<p>The Cingalese catamaran is a log of wood rounded beneath, and scooped out,
with two planks lashed on the top, so as to increase the height above water. It has
a boat-shaped outrigger, supported on two curved poles, to enable it to carry the
large lug-sail, which in a fresh breeze so heels it over that the crew have to sit well
out to windward on the connecting-bars to balance the swift but crazy craft. In the
Mauritius the catamaran is an ordinary boat with a smaller boat at the end of the
outrigger, in which is set a peculiar mizzen. In the Fijis the catamaran becomes a
double canoe, with both hulls exactly the same, and bearing a platform giving just
a little play, so as to allow of the individual peculiarities of the boats being
sufficiently humoured.</p>

<p>These boats, although they may in a few rare cases upset end on&mdash;that is, turn
a somersault&mdash;are the safest craft in the world, for, consisting as they do of double
hulls sustaining a raft, should anything go wrong with the hulls, the raft will never
sink, but will simply settle down until it floats on the waves. Owing to the great
breadth there can be no question of &#8216;initial stability,&#8217; and an ordinary capsize is
impossible, while the very light draught of the hulls will take the craft over places
where even a rowing-boat would meet her doom.</p>

<p>To build such a craft is not difficult, and Mr. W. L. Alden has recently shown
us how it can be well and cheaply done. Adopting the principle of the flying proa
of the Ladrones, which are credited with their twenty knots on a beam wind, he
makes his hulls quite flat on one side, and thus avoids the &#8216;funnel difficulty,&#8217; as it
was called in the case of the Castilia and other steam catamarans, where the inner
sides of the hulls being curved, the water between them was heaped up as it rushed
through the narrowing strait. To make such a catamaran as that shown in our
<a href="#FigXXVII10">sketch</a>&mdash;a craft speedy, safe, and handy, which is easily built, and will bear any
amount of rough usage&mdash;four deal planks are required. These should be fifteen
feet long, eighteen inches wide, and an inch thick. The width is unusually great,
but should single boards not be obtainable, two or three boards can be keyed
together so as to make it up. Take one of the planks, which should have been
bought ready planed, divide it into five equal parts as shown in the diagram, and at
each of the four divisions screw, with brass screws, a three-inch batten three-quarters
of an inch thick. This will not only prevent the plank from warping, but will
strengthen the joints if you are working with a board that has been made up.</p>

</div>

<p class="largeillo"><a href="images/illo294lg.jpg">Fig. 1-6 enlarged</a> (146 kB)</p>

<p>Now shape the ends as shown in <a href="#FigXXVII01">Fig. 1</a>, first with a saw and then with a draw-knife
and spokeshave. Take another of your eighteen-inch planks and treat it in
exactly the same manner, and when you have finished the curves, which should
exactly resemble the others, cut off along the longer side an inch and three-quarters
off every cross-piece, so that when the planks are placed at right angles together they
will fit close. Whitelead these edges thoroughly, and then nail the planks together
with galvanised iron nails, as shown in <a href="#FigXXVII01">Fig. 2</a>, which gives you a section end-on.
Now cut four quadrants eighteen and a quarter inches radius, and off one side cut
a strip an inch wide and trim the other end so as to leave you a piece of the
shape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
shown in <a href="#FigXXVII01">Fig. 3</a>, one side of which (<span class="smcapall">A B</span>)
is seventeen inches long, and the other (<span class="smcapall">A C</span>),
eighteen inches, and which is so made to fit exactly into the angle made by the
broad plank and close against the battens as sketched in <a href="#FigXXVII01">Fig. 4</a>. Finish all the
edges off smooth and square and true, whitelead them well, and fix them in
with galvanised iron nails.</p>

<p>Now make, or get made, six iron staples such as are shown in <a href="#FigXXVII01">Fig. 5</a>, where the
distance from <span class="smcapall">A</span> to <span class="smcapall">B</span> horizontally
and <span class="smcapall">A</span> to <span class="smcapall">C</span> vertically is
just four inches. The iron is
best an inch and a half wide,
between an eighth and a
quarter of an inch thick, and
in it should be three holes,
shown at <span class="smcapall">P</span> and in the ears
marked <span class="smcapall">H</span>, large enough for
quarter-inch bolts. You also
require six other staples of
the shape shown in <a href="#FigXXVII01">Fig. 6</a>,
made of half-inch rod iron
with counter-sunk sockets for
the screws, and these, like the
eared sockets, must be four
inches wide.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 9.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Screw down one of these
eared sockets just where the
curve goes off on the narrower
side, as shown in <a href="#FigXXVII07">Fig. 7</a>,
and in the centre fix a third.
Use galvanised nuts and bolts for fastening, with a thin leather washer under the
bolt and an oak washer under the nut, and make the holes watertight by hard
screwing and plenty of whitelead. To the other edge at the angle, and so as to
project beyond it and correspond with the eared sockets, fix your flat staples, as
shown in <a href="#FigXXVII07">Fig. 8</a>, so that a bar can be passed through each, as shown in <a href="#FigXXVII09">Fig. 9</a>.
Along the centre of the board above which the staples project bore five holes an
inch in diameter, one in the centre of each of the five divisions with which you
started, and then having first fitted a thin batten from <span class="smcapall">A</span>
to <span class="smcapall">B</span>, as shown in <a href="#FigXXVII01">Fig. 4</a>,
and let it down flush into the quadrants, give the construction a thorough coating
of red-lead paint inside and out.</p>

<p>Next get some canvas forty inches wide. Coat it well with boiled oil, dry it
thoroughly, and placing the lower edge of your framework along its centre, strain
it up tight all round. Use copper nails to fasten it with, and running a streak of
paint along its lower edge, finish it there with a thin oak batten, steamed to shape
if necessary, and screwed on outside while the paint is wet, so as to serve
for protection and form the keel. Now give your pontoon a good even coat
of paint, and when that is thoroughly dry give it a trial coat of any colour you
please.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Now make another pontoon in exactly the same way, and when it is finished
fasten both hulls together with three pieces of scantling, as shown in <a href="#FigXXVII09">Fig. 9</a>. The
cross-bars should be nine feet long and four inches square, and kept in their places
by copper bolts slipped into them through the holes in the centre of each of the
sockets.</p>

<p>Next make a platform of quarter-inch boards by nailing them together in two
layers at right angles to each other. Use copper nails and clinch them. Round
the outside of the platform run a low ridge of hard wood, so as to turn it into a tray,
as shown in the sketch, and keep the water off the edges of the boards. Cut out a
dozen grooves for the tops of the sockets to sink into; put the platform flat down on
the cross-bars, and screw it into its place with galvanised nuts and bolts passing
through the bars. The catamaran is now finished and ready for the mast, which can
be stepped in an iron collar raised on three strong iron supports about twenty
inches long, strongly riveted and bolted into the deck. Her sails and spars are
made in the ordinary manner, the same as those of other boats as previously
described. She requires a traverse or ring for the painter, and a rowlock to steer
her by, and then, having carefully overhauled her to see that she is thoroughly
watertight, whiteleaded every crack and crevice, and remembered throughout her
construction never to have nailed a nail or screwed a screw without first covering it
with whitelead, you can give her a farewell top coat of colour. Wait till she is
thoroughly dry, and then, having placed a cork securely in each of the ten holes
leading to her watertight compartments, which holes were made for you to get the
water out in case any should leak in, you can launch her, seize your steering
rudder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
and be off. She will go anywhere and do anything, providing always that the waves
are not rough enough to wash you off her deck.</p>

<p>Says Mr. Alden: &#8216;There is no better boat to cruise in than such a catamaran.
At night you anchor her, unship your mast, pitch your tent, and sleep safely and
comfortably. If you come to a dam you can take the craft apart and carry her
round piecemeal. If you once try to build a catamaran and succeed&mdash;as you
certainly will if you have patience&mdash;you will have the safest and most comfortable
sail-boat in the world.&#8217;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII.&mdash;PRACTICAL HINTS ON TAXIDERMY.<br />
<span class="smcap">By Lieut.-Colonel Cuthell, late 13th Hussars.</span></h3>

<h4 class="fsize80">I.&mdash;CATCHING AND SETTING BUTTERFLIES.</h4>

<p class="noindent">It is surprising at how early an age the sporting instincts of the English race
develop. The ordinary schoolboy let loose for the summer holidays, when not
actively engaged at any game, is apt to look about him for something to destroy,
and to destroy aimlessly and indiscriminately also. Now there are few surer
protections against such a reprehensible habit than to make the Creator&#8217;s works in
some branch or other a special study. The practical entomologist never kills for
the mere sake of killing, and when he does deprive of life he endeavours to do so with
as little cruelty as possible. Hence we need make no apology for this chapter.
When we consider how many men hunt for exercise, or for food or clothing for the
body, one can hardly consistently condemn a little margin to feed the mind.</p>

<p>Most boys have a taste for natural history, and the following practical hints may,
it is hoped, tend to develop it, by teaching them not only how to destroy life, but
how to preserve what they have destroyed. Thus they may learn wonderful lessons
regarding the habits and the structure of the marvellous insects and birds and beasts
with which the Almighty has peopled this beautiful world of ours.</p>

<p>I propose to begin with hints about butterflies, because the average British boy
is apt first to turn his hunting instincts to these. Yet the catching and collecting of
butterflies is a pursuit worthy of any age, and, to be done well, requires dexterity,
delicacy of touch, and care. Under these conditions, and armed with a few simple
implements, there is no reason why any boy should not, in time, become the happy
possessor of one of the most beautiful of natural history collections, the which,
should fate ever call upon him to leave his native shores, he will, in other climes,
find a new pleasure in increasing. For butterflies may be collected in many a dull,
out-of-the-way quarter, where larger game is conspicuous by its absence, or the
means of pursuing it wanting.</p>

<p>The first consideration, however, is the momentous question, as to which is a
butterfly and which is a moth? The answer to this is, that butterflies have blunt
ends like pins-heads at the points of their antenn&aelig;, and that moths have none. In
England there are seventy-two sorts of butterflies, not to be confounded with night
or day moths, which number over nine hundred families in this country alone. A
point which strikes the collector almost at the beginning, are the extremely local
habits of butterflies. In almost every place new specimens are to be found, and
the varied flight of each kind will soon lead the collector to learn to detect a new
species. These are usually classed by their undermarkings, as many which present
the same appearance on the top side are different underneath. My small boy,
with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
his rough cotton net and wild shout, left very little of the unfortunate insect he
had captured, to put into his trouser pocket! The greatest care and manipulation
are required to procure a specimen fit for a collection.</p>

<p>The net should be of silk gauze, fitted on to the circle of cane, nearly eighteen
inches across. The two ends of the cane should run into a <span class="lettsymb">T</span>-shaped brass socket.
The foot of the <span class="lettsymb">T</span> is a screw, which screws into the stick handle, the which may be
used also either to hold a gaff or a landing net. The circle of cane should be
covered with some soft thick flannel, firstly, that the silk gauze may be sewn on
securely, and, secondly, that the butterflies, which are often struck by the rim of the
net, are not injured by it. The flannel is, moreover, a saving to the wear and tear
of the net.</p>

<p>Another kind of net is the collector&#8217;s scissor net, with which you can pick a
butterfly off a flower. It is about five inches square, in the form of two bags
mounted one on each point of a wire, which opens and shuts.</p>

<p>Having caught the butterfly, the next thing is to kill him. A pinch through the
net, across the thorax (the part from which the wings spring) will accomplish this.
For obstinate specimens, such as &#8216;skippers,&#8217; a lethal
chamber can be prepared, in the shape of a wide-mouthed
two-pound jam bottle, with a well-fitting
cork. At the bottom of this is fixed some blotting-paper,
on which a few drops of chloroform have
been poured. The butterfly should be left in the
bottle a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>The specimens can be carried home in safety
in a collector&#8217;s box, about five inches long by three
deep and broad, in the pocket. Triangular envelopes,
varying in size, according to that of the
butterfly, are often used. Into these the insects
can be slipped with folded wings, and left for any
length of time till it is convenient to relax and set
him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXVIII01">
<img src="images/illo300.jpg" alt="butterfly" width="300" height="348" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>Now for the setting of the butterfly. Drying-boards
can be bought of any length, made either of
soft deal, or, better still, of cork, covered with white paper. They have a groove
down the centre to receive the insect&#8217;s body. Different widths are required for
different-sized insects. Place the row of butterflies to be set down the board, their
bodies pinned in the groove. Cut strips of writing paper an eighth of an inch
wide. Pin a strip of paper on each side of the groove, about the centre. Secure
it additionally by a pin between each butterfly. With the point of a pin arrange
the wings equally under the strips (<a href="#FigXXVIII01">Fig. 1</a>). These drying-boards should be kept
out of the dust, or ants or flies may damage the specimens. Some people have a
box with a perforated zinc door, into which they slide the boards. I called such an
one my meat safe!</p>

<p>In the case of dried specimens preserved in envelopes and which need relaxing
before setting, there are two ways of going to work. The first is to float a piece of
cork in hot water, and to pin the specimen on to the cork. The wings should
not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
touch the water. A saucepan is a good thing to use, as the lid can be put on. The
cork should float high in the water.</p>

<p>But the best plan is to steam them in a tin box with cork in the lid. Pin the
insects to the cork and half fill the box with boiling water, and close it. If the
boiling water as it cools is renewed two or three times, in an hour or so the insects
will be perfectly relaxed. They should then be set at once, after shaking off the
drops from the wings, and placed near enough to the fire to feel the heat and to
dry quickly, but not too near. The outer margins of the wings should be covered
with the setting braces (the paper strips), or they will curl up with the heat. The
wings should, if possible, not be allowed to touch the cork when being relaxed, as
they suck up the moisture.</p>

<p>A butterfly cabinet with drawers is very expensive, and beyond the means of
most boys. Cases to hold the butterflies should be uniform in size, made of
mahogany, seasoned deal, or cedar, and lined with cork, to be procured at any
shoemaker&#8217;s, and fitted with a glass lid on hinges. These can be hung as ornaments
against the wall. In one corner should be fixed a little perforated tin match box
containing a lump of camphor. The appearance of a collection is much improved
by having a piece of black cotton stretched from two pins down the box, between
the lines of butterflies. Cases for travelling should on no account be glazed, but
be shaped like a book, with a hinge in the centre, that the butterflies may be put on
either side.</p>

<p>The pins used had better be the headless taxidermist pins, sold for the purpose,
which being so much slighter than the ordinary pins, do not spoil the specimens.</p>

<p>Should the larger butterflies show signs of decay in their bodies, paint them with
a little solution of carbolic acid, equal parts of acid and water.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to catch more than four or five good specimens of each class.
First, the male (which is much smaller than the female), secondly, the female, can be
set out. Then two butterflies, which have been set with their wings closed to show
the undermarkings, can be placed body to body to economise space. The fifth
specimen may be some abnormal one of the same class, if such has been caught.</p>

<p>All valuable collections are kept away from the light, which deteriorates them.
In the British Museum but few specimens are shown to the general public, and even
the cases containing these are covered with a square of American cloth, which the
public are asked to replace after looking at them. The real collection is kept
downstairs, and can only be seen by applying for an order.</p>

<p>Some of the best specimens in England have been bred for collection from the
caterpillar. This accounts, to my mind, for the occasional appearance of some
brilliant foreign specimen in this country. It has probably escaped from some one&#8217;s
menagerie. I caught last year, on the southern coast, a beautiful specimen of the
North American <i>linea plexippus</i> in such perfect condition that it could not possibly
have been wafted across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>No creature in Nature goes through such marvellous evolutionary changes as the
butterfly. It emerges from the chrysalis hanging on the bough, the male appearing
fifteen days earlier than the female. This latter lays her eggs, as it were, on her
death-bed, and they are hatched the following year into the minutest of larv&aelig;. Each
kind of butterfly lays its eggs in a spot where the caterpillar can procure the
food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
peculiar to it. Thus caterpillars kept in confinement require each kind a different
sort of leaf. Some caterpillars hibernate and do not turn into a chrysalis till the
second year.</p>

<p>In concluding this part of my subject, I must warn boys against handling hairy
caterpillars with bare hands, as when the hand touches the face or neck it is apt to
produce a rash like nettle-rash.</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">II.&mdash;HOW TO CURE AND SET UP A BIRD&#8217;S SKIN.</h4>

<p>The wholesale destruction, for the sheer love of taking life, which goes on at all
seasons round our seacoasts, is simply appalling. It is trusted that these hints on
bird-stuffing may not stimulate it, but rather, by leading boys to take an interest in
the marvellous structure of bird life, to venerate and spare it, shooting only here
and there a solitary specimen for preservation.</p>

<p>On inspecting a bird which is intended for stuffing, it must be borne in mind that
many species change their plumage in summer and in winter. This applies
especially to sea-birds, and it is often difficult to recognise an individual in his sober
winter garb as contrasted with his rich summer attire. Therefore it is quite
allowable to preserve two specimens of the same sex and class, in order to show the
difference in their plumage.</p>

<p>Mid-winter or midsummer is the best time to shoot birds for stuffing, as when
they have been recently sitting, or moulting, their feathers are apt to be worn or
only half formed. Be careful to use only small shot and small charges, at short
distances, for small birds, or the skin will be irretrievably damaged. Increase the
charge in proportion to the size of the bird, but it should never be a very heavy one.
A friend once brought me to stuff a tame parrot of his which had flown away.
Thinking to injure the skin the less, he had shot it with a charge of peas, but with
the result of crushing it almost to a jelly, tearing the skin so that it was useless.</p>

<p>In the event of the bird being only wounded, press the breast bone in with the
finger and thumb till life be extinct. This operation will not take more than two
minutes. Push a piece of cotton wool down the throat, a piece of thread through
the nose just above the beak, and make a loop to hold the bird by. Carefully
examine the bird for any wounds, and stop such with a small plug of cotton wool.
This will prevent the blood staining the feathers. Smooth down these with a
handkerchief and pull out any that are bloodstained, as the sacrifice of a feather
here and there is immaterial.</p>

<p>When the bird is brought safely home, it must be decided whether it should be
slit down the back or down the breast, or whether, as in the case of large-headed
birds like kingfishers, a small incision should be made in the throat, to skin the
head through. But first, as regards the implements for the process, which need
only be few and simple&mdash;a couple of dissecting knives with celt handles, a pair of
pointed scissors, a large fish-hook, and a small gouge for the eyes being all that is
required for the skinning process. For the setting-up we must add a file for giving
the wires a sharp point, and a pair of compasses to measure the body.</p>

<p>Then place the bird on its back, and cut it open from the top of the breast bone
to within a short distance of the vent. If, however, the specimen is one
remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
for the beauty of its breast plumage, the process must be reversed. Break both the
wing bones under the wings, and place a clean piece of wool in the mouth. Remove
the skin with the celt handle of the knife. Here it must be explained that the
term <i>celt</i> handle is derived from the prehistoric flint implements dug up in ancient
barrows, and which, being necessarily blunt, have given their names to the blunt
bone handles of dissecting knives. As you work along sprinkle the skin with a
powder of wood ash, plaster-of-paris, or flour. It is a great help to have a fish-hook
run through the top of the breast bone, and held firmly by another person, or
tied to a hook on the wall. The neck must be cut through when it is met with,
likewise the wings where they are broken, and the top joints of the legs. Use great
care in drawing the skin down the back, as that is very frequently the most delicate
place.</p>

<p><i>The Head.</i>&mdash;If the head is very much larger than the neck, cut the throat
lengthways to remove the head. It is immaterial whether the eyes are taken out
before the head is skinned down or after. The gouge should go well to the back of
the eye and separate the ligament which holds it to the socket. Should the gouge
go into the eye, it will let out the moisture, which often damages the skin. Some
people crush the skull slightly to make it come out of the skin easily, but this I
do not advise. Remove the brains by taking out a piece of the skull at the
back as you cut off the neck. Pull the eyes out of their cavity and fill up their
place with wool soaked in arsenical soap. Anoint the skin of the head and the
neck well with arsenical soap, and place in the neck a piece of stick covered with
wool, the end of which put into the hole made in the skull for extracting the
brains.</p>

<p><i>The Wings.</i>&mdash;Remove the meat from the wings on the inside as far as you can
skin. When you have taken out the body, to finish the wings, cut them open from
the outside under the large wing feathers, which be careful not to detach from
the large bone. Remove all the meat most carefully, and anoint with arsenical
soap.</p>

<p><i>The Legs.</i>&mdash;Skin down as far as you can, remove the meat, anoint the skin with
arsenical soap, and cover the leg bones with paper, to prevent them damaging
the skin.</p>

<p><i>The Feet</i> can be left alone, unless large, when they can be cut into and
anointed.</p>

<p><i>The Tail</i> and <i>the Back</i>, if that of a large bird and very fat, like that of a peacock,
should be well covered with wood ash, and scraped till as much fat as can be
removed comes away. Then anoint freely with arsenical soap, fill the body with
wool or paper, not too full, and close it with a couple of stitches across the breast.
Smooth all the feathers into their place, and leave in a dry place before packing,
for a day or two. Then pack the paper round the whole, to prevent the skin from
being damaged.</p>

<p>So far the skin has only been cured, an operation which, in the case of a small
bird and practised hands, takes about seven minutes. Next for the setting up.
Though the skin thus preserved may be laid by and keep good for years, and may
at any time be set up by a professional, yet it is a great amusement for a boy to
stuff his birds himself, and this is how it is done<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXVIII02">
<img src="images/illo304.png" alt="bird" width="250" height="287" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>

<p>The body and the neck which have been taken out of the bird serve as models.
The former is copied in tow, wound round with cotton. Through this is run a
sharp-pointed piece of wire, bent over and fastened at the tail end. It protrudes
beyond the body, is wrapped round with tow or wool to imitate the neck, and run
up the latter, from which the stick has been removed. The point is run through the
skull, bent back and made fast (<a href="#FigXXVIII02">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>Then run a sharpened wire up each leg, inside, starting from beneath the foot,
and sticking into the body, where it is doubled back. Be careful that these wires
are exactly in the centre of the body, or the legs will appear too far back.</p>

<p>The body and neck of the bird are now stuffed, but form a straight line. Sew
up the breast with a few stitches, and with the following manipulation give the right
curve to the neck: Bend it back at a little more than a right angle to the body,
pressing with the thumb where the neck joins the body. Then press with the thumb
at the back of the neck, and with the other hand pull
the neck forward again. This will give it the desired
graceful curve.</p>

<p>In a small piece of board, drill two holes in the
position in which you wish the feet to be. Run the
wires of the feet through these, turn them back, and
fix them. Push the body slightly back, and, at the
same time, bend the legs at the joints. If the bird
is flying, the legs should not be bent, but straight out
parallel with the body.</p>

<p>The position of the wings must also depend on
that of the bird. If it is flying, they must be kept
stretched out by a wire run through underneath them
horizontally, catching each individual feather. If the
wings are closed, needle points are enough to pin them
through to the body. The thickness of the wire must
depend on the size of the bird. The tail must be likewise fixed with wire. The eyes
may now be put in by opening the eyelids and forcing them down far enough into the
head, and then carefully manipulating the eyelid to get the eye to sit right. When
a bird is first shot the colour of the eye should be noticed, and be matched as nearly
as possible when buying the glass eyes.</p>

<p>When thus completed, the specimen will often present a battered and ugly
appearance, but it is wonderful how much it will improve with careful touching up,
and arranging the feathers with a needle point or probe. Varnishing the beak and
legs is a further improvement. An artistic effect is obtained by considering the
nature and habits of the specimen, and studying its natural poses. For instance, a
pheasant struts with a straight neck, a swan sits on the water with its neck gracefully
arched.</p>

<p>The arsenical soap above mentioned can be procured at any chemist&#8217;s, or made
as follows: camphor, five drachms; arsenic, four ounces; white soap, four ounces;
flaked lime, four ounces; mix with a little water into a soft paste.</p>

<p>Before using the arsenical soap, be careful to remove every scrap of meat from
the skin. Be most careful, also, to wash the hands after using it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>A group of birds can be arranged in a case on imitation rocks, in the following
manner: Lay a piece of paper over the wood stand on which the birds are fixed,
and arrange it in the shape of rock and stones. Pour over it a hot solution
consisting of one part glue, one part whiting, and one part sand, which in a short
time becomes very hard. Dried stick, ferns, and grasses, or shells, can be added.</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">III.&mdash;ON PRESERVING THE SKINS AND HEADS OF ANIMALS.</h4>

<p>Although the manner of setting-up animals is somewhat similar to that of birds,
the mode of preserving the skins and furs is very different. Whereas a bird has a
most delicate skin, and is eventually put into a glass case out of the dust, an
animal&#8217;s hide, in nine cases out of ten, is either used as a carriage or hearth rug, or
a footstool, or, as in the case of a head, hung unprotected against the wall.</p>

<p>As in all probability tiger and buffalo skins will not come in the way of the
readers of these lines, it is rather such &#8216;small deer&#8217; as the denizens of our English
woods they will be anxious to preserve, to wit, foxes&#8217; heads, cats, otters, stoats,
weazels, moles, or water-rats. But the following hints apply equally to a tiger-skin
or a squirrel&#8217;s<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Let us begin by imagining the keeper has brought in a fine large poaching cat.
Take the beast to an out-house, and in the shade lay it on its back, and with a
butcher&#8217;s, or indeed any sharp knife, make a long, straight, but not too deep cut,
from the centre of the lower jaw to the end of the tail. Then cut down the legs on
the underneath side till the cut down the centre of the body is reached. Now
separate the skin from the body. If the animal has been badly shot, wash the skin
thoroughly in cold soap and water. Place it in water for twenty-four hours. Then
take it out and scrape it well from any fat; skin the ears on the inside and plunge it
into a hot solution of one part salt and two parts alum, and let it soak well in. The
solution should not be hotter than the hand can bear, and the skin should be left in
it twenty-four hours. Then stretch the skin, hair downwards, on a board, nailing it
with tacks round the edge. Be careful to get it the proper shape, and that one side
is not more stretched than the other. Next apply a paste made of one part finely
powdered alum, two parts chalk. When this is dry beat it off with a stick, and
apply some more where the skin seems still to contain grease. After this remove
the skin from the board when quite dry, and the more it is rubbed with the hand,
the softer it will become.</p>

<p>Another process is to wash the skin well, and to peg it out on the ground or on
a board, to rub it well with wood ashes, and to sprinkle it with carbolic acid
and water in proportion of one part to thirty. Next with a knife cleanse the skin
most thoroughly of every particle of flesh and fat, and rub in more wood ash till there
is no grease left. Then keep the skin perfectly dry till you have an opportunity
of sending it to a tanner&#8217;s. But no skin or fur, whether tanned or not, should ever
be put in the sun. A good shaking and hanging out in the air is the best thing
for it.</p>

<p>It is obvious that if a skin is to be used as a rug, the use of arsenic or other
poisons is out of the question, though where an animal is to be set up and put in
a glass case, like a weazel or a stoat, this rule does not apply. In this latter case
an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
incision is made between the forelegs and down the belly, large enough to allow
of the animal&#8217;s body being extracted. The skin, when properly cleaned from fat
and flesh, is plunged into cold carbolic acid and water, in the proportion of one part
carbolic to forty of water. After lying in this for a week, it can be taken out and
freely anointed with arsenical soap previous to setting up.</p>

<p>And now for the treatment of the head of a horned animal. Within six or
eight hours of the death of the beast, cut off the head with a long neck. Cut the
skin down the back of the neck as far as the two horns. Should the animal have
no horns, this is unnecessary; should it have spiral horns, cut only up to one and
round the other. Then remove the skin entirely from the skull, taking care that
the skin round the eyes does not get injured, as it is a most delicate place, the
skin there is so thin, and lies so close to the bone. Hang the head up in the
outhouse and scrape and clean at leisure. Saw off a bit of the skull, and remove the
brains. On no account lose the lower jawbones when they become detached.</p>

<p>Horns that will come off the bone, such as antelope&#8217;s, sheep&#8217;s, or goat&#8217;s, soak for
a day or two in a tub of water a week or two after the animal has been killed.</p>

<p>Wash the skin well in soap and water, removing all the bits of meat. Split the
lips and skin up the ears from the inside as far as you can, removing as much meat
from them as can be filled in afterwards with cotton wool and not detected from the
outside when the head is set up. Then place the skin in a jar of carbolic acid and
water, enough to cover it, and let it remain there for six or eight weeks, until
opportunity occurs to set up the head. It could even be packed up and sent
away like this, as it were, in pickle. If the skin be much stained with extravasated
blood, a few hours&#8217; soaking in water will draw it out.</p>

<p>Next for the setting-up process. Take the skull, and fasten the upper and lower
jaws in their places with wire. Set the skull on a wooden neck, the same length as
the natural one, and set this neck on to a wooden shield to hang against the wall.
Be careful to set the neck at a natural angle to the head. A deer holds his nose
very high; a pig very low. If preferred, the shield can be dispensed with, and the
staple by which to hang the head fixed in the wooden neck through the skin.</p>

<p>In many instances a solid wooden neck would be too heavy; but a small one
filled out with tow, and fastened into the hole in the skull through which the brains
were extracted, will answer the purpose just as well.</p>

<p>Fill the cavities in the skull for the eyes with putty, and put some wool under the
jaws, some putty to form the nose, and enough to give a thickness to the nose.
Then insert the glass eyes, which, in the case of a large animal, can be made from
French wine bottles by breaking out the kick at the bottom. But manufactured
eyes are much preferable. I have frequently bought cases of white glass eyes and
painted them at the back the right colour. While on the subject of eyes, it may be
mentioned that carnivorous animals have the light in the eye down the eye from top
to bottom, while granivorous animals have it across.</p>

<p>Next take the skin out of the solution and smear the inside well with a paste of
arsenical soap. Put some wool into the ears, and draw the skin over the skull like
a glove. Sew up the cut at the back with a shoemaker&#8217;s awl. With a few tacks
nail the skin on to the shield, and put a few stitches into the mouth to keep it
properly closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>A few pinches and touches will set the head, as it dries, into its natural form.
When nearly dry, comb and brush the hair well.</p>

<p>A common mistake is to put wool or putty where there is no meat, which
detracts from the wild look of the animal.</p>

<p>Only use white medicated carbolic acid crystal; it liquefies in a little warmth.
Carbolic acid is a poison, and will burn the hands and clothes if not carefully
handled. The antidote is oil. But when used in the proportion of one to forty
parts of water it will do no harm.</p>

<p>The nose and lips of a head can be touched up with a little Brunswick black,
and the horns oiled.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me beg no boy to be discouraged with his first attempt, as often
fine furred animals, like a fox, look very woebegone on first emerging from the
solution, but improve vastly as they begin to dry and the hair to stand out naturally.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.&mdash;HINTS ON POLISHING HORN, BONE, SHELLS,
STONES, ETC.<br />
<span class="smcap">By Gordon Stables, C.M., M.D., R.N.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">He was a mean-looking man, to say the least of it. Even the coat he wore was
a mile too big for him, albeit some time in the far-distant past it might have graced
the shoulders of a country squire. Yes, he was decidedly mean-looking, nor did
his character, as it came out, belie his appearance.</p>

<p>He shuffled when he walked and he snuffled when he talked, and was altogether
unwholesome and undesirable. He and I were the only two&mdash;ahem!&mdash;gentlemen
that stood on the little railway platform of B&mdash;&mdash; on a cold November morning,
waiting for a late train that only stopped by signal.</p>

<p>Having been three or four times round the Cape and twice in the Polar regions,
I dare say I look simple. Anyhow, it wasn&#8217;t long ere this mean-looking man
addressed me.</p>

<p>&#8216;Begging yer parding, sir,&#8217; he said, &#8216;but could ye spare a trifle to a pore man
wot&#8217;s got a starving wife and five babs dependin&#8217; on &#8217;im for a lively&#8217;ood. Maybe,
sir, you&#8217;d buy these &#8217;ere &#8217;orns. I seed yer was a lookin&#8217; at &#8217;em, and I seed ye were
a gent, sir, soon&#8217;s ever I clapped eyes on yer.&#8217;</p>

<p>He carried three nicely polished sets of ox-horns in his arms&mdash;a large, a medium,
and a small.</p>

<p>&#8216;They are very nice indeed,&#8217; I said. &#8216;Are they attached to the skull?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh dear, yes, sir,&#8217; he said; &#8216;a piece of the skull were a-sawed out for the sake
o&#8217; the lovely &#8217;orns, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And where might they come from?&#8217; I asked; &#8216;and what might be their value?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They belongs to the wild buffalo of the plains of Arfriker, sir. My nevey
brought &#8217;em &#8217;ome. Been refused fifteen pound for &#8217;em. You shall &#8217;ave &#8217;em for
five, sir, &#8217;cause I can see yer a gent. If I can&#8217;t sell &#8217;em, sir, they&#8217;ll &#8217;ave to be broke
for combs, and that would be a peety, sir, them bootiful harticles, quite a hornament
for any gentleman&#8217;s &#8217;all like yourn.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sorry I can&#8217;t trade to-day,&#8217; I replied, as I jumped into the train.</p>

<p>I saw no more of the man, for though he alighted at the same town as I did, he
sidled his way through the crowd, making determined attempts, one would have
thought, to gouge eyes out in all directions with his &#8216;bootiful &#8217;orns.&#8217; I saw no
more of the <i>man</i>, but strange to say I did of the &#8216;<i>&#8217;orns</i>&#8217; that same evening. They
had been sold to a friend of mine for just five times their value. They had never
come from Africa, of course; the larger pair had at one time probably adorned the
head of some Highland bull. The others were probably English.</p>

<p>I do not believe this mean-looking man had polished those horns himself. He
looked far too lazy for that; but in justice to the &#8217;orns, if not to the man, I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
say they were very well done indeed, and would have made, as he said, &#8216;quite a
<i>horn</i>ament for any gentleman&#8217;s &#8217;all.&#8217;</p>

<p>There is no end to the beautiful articles that can be manufactured from hoof or
horn. Stuffed heads with the horns polished look very nice on the walls of rooms
or in halls. I was in the drawing-room of a Highland cattle-breeder of fame the
other day, and was both surprised and delighted to find on the walls, in recesses
and places where there was room, not only the horns but heads, with necks and a
portion of the brisket attached, of old favourites looking at me.</p>

<p>A ram&#8217;s head, with the crooked horns attached, makes a beautiful snuff-box.
The box itself lies between the horns&mdash;or rather in the forehead&mdash;and is of silver,
the lid usually adorned with a gigantic cairn-gorm. My Scotch readers know the
sort of thing I mean.</p>

<p>But here we are again with another snuff-horn, more cheaply manufactured too.
You simply get a shortish cow-horn and beautifully polish it; then another round flat
piece of polished horn to form the lid. To this is attached, by means of silver nails,
a piece of cork big enough to fit nicely into the mouth of the horn, and not more
than an eighth of an inch thick. Then the lid is complete, and any watchmaker
will hinge it on for you. Get also a little heart-shaped bit of silver, let into either
the lid or the back of the horn, with the initials of the giver and the <i>givee</i>, thus:
&#8216;From A. H. to W. H.&#8217;</p>

<p>Still another&mdash;a horse&#8217;s hoof. And there are many, many more which I do not
at present remember, and need not enumerate if I did. But if you wish to see the
many lovely articles that can be manufactured from polished horn, I prithee station
thyself for a few brief moments anent a good jeweller&#8217;s window in any large city or
town in the kingdom, and keep your weather-eye lifting.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard the Latin proverb, <i>Aut C&aelig;sar aut nullus</i>? The English
translate it, or paraphrase it, &#8216;Neck or nothing.&#8217; I have heard a Scotchman speak
of a boy in the following terms, which embody the same sentiment: &#8216;That boy will
either make a spoon or spoil a horn.&#8217;</p>

<p>Now, then, if you are going to try your hand at horn-polishing, you must please
bear that motto in mind, &#8216;<i>Aut C&aelig;sar aut nullus</i>.&#8217; You must either make a spoon
or spoil a horn. But as horns are very cheap in the rough, it does not matter much
if you do spoil one or two. Only this sort of work requires patience&mdash;and not only
patience, but a deal of hard rubbing and much expenditure of elbow-grease.</p>

<p>Well, get your horns first. Where? you ask. You may go to your butcher and
explain what you want, and he will tell you that the horns are sawn off with the
hide and sent to the tanner&#8217;s thus. But if he be a civil man, as most butchers are,
he will keep a pair for you, and he will probably knock them off, not saw them, so
that you will be at once free from the awkward piece of bone that runs up the first
portion of the centre; otherwise you would have to get this taken out.</p>

<p>Now the tools you want are not numerous. A very handy, and in some cases
indispensable, one is what is called a spokeshave. It is for paring down the rough
surfaces. It is a handy tool for woodwork as well, and as it costs only about
eighteen pence, it is as well to have one among your tools. Just let me pause here
for one instant to repeat a warning I have given more than once before. Never
buy bad cheap tools. What are called boys&#8217; boxes of tools are, as a rule, mere toys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>&mdash;an
insult to any growing lad who really means to do proper work. Make your
own tool-box; buy your tools separately, and see that they are good. Indeed, it
would be as well to get them second-hand at a broker&#8217;s shop. No matter if they
be a little old so long as the steel is good, and the woodwork neither worn nor
cracked.</p>

<p>Well, you must have a good knife with several blades&mdash;not a mere pot-metal
cheese-cutter. This knife will come in handy for paring and for scraping. And
what I myself have found very handy is a piece or two of plain window-glass. Glass
makes a capital scraper, and when the edge goes off you have only to break it again
and you find another. I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if you found a piece of sticking-plaster
handy too. Do you know how to bind up a cut? Well, get any dirt there may be
in it out first. Then, when the bleeding has stopped, bring the edges together with
<i>two or three narrow</i> bits of plaster, leaving a tiny outlet for oozing, put a rag over
all, and there you are.</p>

<p>The spokeshave is only to be used in paring down all the rough portions of your
horn, and you must work with, and not against, the rough <i>lamin&aelig;</i>, that is, from and
<i>not</i> towards the points of the horn. You will have a difficulty in holding your work,
because the spokeshave is best used with both hands. You may fasten the horn in
a vice or on the end of a stick, or any other way that occurs to you.</p>

<p>After the spokeshave the knife will come in handy, but you <i>must</i> have an even
surface, and all stains must be removed. You will find the horn get harder and
whiter beneath, and semi-transparent. It is down to this you want to go, but no
farther.</p>

<p>Then after the knife comes your bit of glass, and while working with this, wherever
you see any part out of symmetry, work carefully on that till you get all even
and nice. When this is done half the work is finished.</p>

<p>When you have pared and scraped and cut down all unevenness, and have at last
got a fairly plain surface by dint of hard labour with spokeshave, knife, and glass&mdash;perhaps
a fine file may have aided you through some intricacies; this tool comes in
handy enough when you want to polish bent horns&mdash;then you must have recourse to
emery-paper. This is very cheap, and is sold in sheets of different fineness at colour
shops or oil-merchants&#8217;.</p>

<p>Begin by using the roughest, then finer and finer.</p>

<p>Be tidy with your work. The dust that comes off horn is one of the best things
in the world for soiling the waistcoat or nether garments. So place your horn over
a piece of brown paper. You thus save your dress and save your dust as well. Put
the latter in a saucer, and a drop or two of olive or colza oil over it. Mix and use
it with a bit of chamois leather to polish with, after you have finished with the
emery-paper or emery-paper and water.</p>

<p>If you feel discouraged and disappointed at want of gloss and beauty, depend
upon it you have not worked hard enough. So you must go on again. Use next
tripoli, or rouge, or both, first mixed with a little olive oil, and finally dry. Tripoli
is the name given to a kind of infusorial earth, which was first found in Tripoli. It
is now obtained in certain districts of the United States, and in many parts of
Europe.</p>

<p>The name rouge may be somewhat misleading, there being so many different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
kinds of it. Ladies use a rouge composed of chalk and carmine. This will not do
so well for polishing horn. I believe, however, if you take equal parts of carbonate
of iron and prepared chalk and rub them up together in a mortar, you will form a
very nice rouge for the purpose of polishing either horn or plate. Polishers&#8217; putty-powder
is another article used for finishing off horns.</p>

<p>Well, you must put your final touches to the horn or hoof with simple chamois
or prepared wash-leather, and after this it ought to shine as if waxed.</p>

<p>You will know by this time that in a horn there is a densely solid tip, and also at
the other end a hollow part. The thinner end is used for making combs, etc. It
is softened in boiling water, then exposed to a flame till partially fluid, then cut into
the shapes desired. In this state the horn can be pulled flat if wished. After it
has been pressed and prepared, the piece of horn, comb, or whatever it happens to
be, is scraped and polished in the way we have described.</p>

<p>A great many useful articles are made from the solid or tip portion of horns, a
great many useful and very beautiful articles, some of which are turned by the lathe,
while others are cut. Whip-handles, stick and umbrella handles, and handles for
knives and small tools, may be made from horn and afterwards scraped and
polished. Goats&#8217; and sheep&#8217;s horns are clearer and more transparent than those of
the ox. They are not more easy to work on that account, however, but being clear
they take staining better. They should be polished before being stained.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether those useful liquid dyes that are sold in the shops would
do for staining horn, bone, or ivory, because I have never tried them, but I think if
used boiling hot and the articles to be stained thereby were immersed in them for
some time, the stain would be permanent. You see I have classed bone, horn, and
ivory together, because in this case what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the
gander. Here are receipts for a few stains<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blankbefore"><i>Black.</i>&mdash;You may stain these substances black, and wood also, by frequent
immersion in hot ink, or by leaving them for a few days in the ink, or in a solution
of nitrate of silver, twenty grains to the ounce.</p>

<p>The latter preparation is poison, remember, and it will burn and stain the clothes
or anything it may come in contact with.</p>

<p>Black may also be got by boiling in a strong decoction of logwood, and afterwards
placing in a bath of acetate of iron.</p>

<p><i>Purple.</i>&mdash;This colour is obtained by boiling in a strong decoction of logwood
and alum until the proper tint is acquired. It must be done in an enamelled
saucepan, else the colour will be a failure.</p>

<p><i>Red.</i>&mdash;You may steep the article in hot red ink, letting it lie for a day or two.
See that you get the best and brightest ink procurable. But you may also get a
nice colour by first steeping for ten minutes in dilute nitric acid, then immersing
in a decoction of cochineal or cochineal dissolved in liquid ammonia.</p>

<p><i>Scarlet.</i>&mdash;This colour is acquired if you steep the articles or boil them in a
decoction of brazil-wood or in madder, and then in a solution of muriate of tin.</p>

<p><i>Blue.</i>&mdash;Steeping in a strong solution of sulphate of copper will impart a light
blue. If dark blue is wanted, the article must be boiled in a solution of sulphate of
indigo in which a little salt of tartar has been dissolved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Green.</i>&mdash;This is got either by boiling for a time in a solution of verdigris in
vinegar, or an article already stained blue by the process above mentioned may be
steeped in nitro-muriate of tin.</p>

<p><i>Yellow.</i>&mdash;Immerse for a day or two in a solution of chromate of potash, then for
a few minutes in boiling-hot solution of sugar-of-lead. Or you may reverse this
order and steep first in the sugar-of-lead solution, then in that of chromate of potash.</p>

<p class="blankbefore">Now to return for a moment to our horns. After you have nicely polished
them you will naturally want to set them up. To do this you must get a piece of
thick softish wood, and shape therefrom something in the semblance of a piece of
the animal&#8217;s skull and forehead that the horns originally belonged to, leaving at
each upper side a piece of wood, rounded, some inches long. To these elongated
corners you fix the horns. The next thing will be to cover the wooden skull with
something resembling the skin of the animal. Real skin, well preserved, will of
course suit best, and it is to be brought round and tacked on the nether side. But
black or brown astrakan cloth will generally do very well.</p>

<p>Your work is now finished, and you may hang the horns in your hall if you have
one; if not, they will look well above the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>Very nice powder-horns may be made in the same way. Lads who wear the
kilt, or Highland dress, sling these in a chain over the chest and shoulders, and
handsome ornaments they make.</p>

<p><i>Bones</i> of any kind are polished by paring, scraping, and rubbing in precisely the
same way that horns are; and so is ivory, though it is much more difficult to work
owing to its hardness. It is also very expensive.</p>

<p><i>Tortoiseshell</i> requires great care in polishing, because it is thinner than horn, and
you are apt to cut through it. Scrape it carefully first with a knife, then with glass,
then with very fine glasspaper and water, or bath-brick and oil; next with rottenstone
and oil. But the rottenstone must be specially prepared for the purpose. It
should be pounded in a mortar&mdash;what a handy thing a mortar is for purposes
innumerable! and it is not at all an expensive article&mdash;pounded well, and afterwards
run through fine muslin. It is used mixed with oil.</p>

<p>The final polish for tortoiseshell is obtained by rubbing hard and well with
jewellers&#8217; rouge (a preparation of calcined oxide of iron). This is used upon a piece
of prepared washleather.</p>

<p>Imitations of tortoiseshell are made from horn. The horn is a clear sort, and
generally brought from the South of Europe. The pieces of horn are softened by
steam, pressed flat, polished, and afterwards stained. They are then smeared here
and there with a composition made for the purpose, and which may be got in the
shops. Before this is put on, the horn is steeped in a weak solution of nitric acid.
The paint is left on for a time and afterwards rubbed off, when it will take a polish,
the stain remaining as if burned in. I think the paint is composed of litharge and
quicklime, equal parts, mixed in whiting-and-water.</p>

<p><i>Seashells</i> are pretty when polished. There is a deal of stuff to be worked off
the outside of them, however, before you get down to the coloured or beautiful
portion. Do this by scraping after you have steeped the work for some time in
dilute aquafortis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>Practise on a mussel-shell first. Get a good large one. Polish with emery-paper
and oil, finishing off with polishers&#8217; putty and oil and rouge. When you have
polished your mussel-shell, mount it by means of cement on a small polished slab of
marble. It makes a most beautiful paper-weight, and you will find, too, that in this
simple shell you have an excellent model of the hull of a yacht.</p>

<p><i>Stones.</i>&mdash;These require, first and foremost, to be sawn into the shape you want
them. Then the work must be held firm in a vice while you do the polishing.
Soft stone and water are used to begin the smoothing-down. The stone used
is called &#8216;grit-rock,&#8217; and is of different kinds, the finest being used last. Next a
stone is used, the popular name of which is &#8216;snake-stone,&#8217; then polishers&#8217; putty-powder,
etc.</p>

<p>Beautiful ornaments can be made from various kinds of stone, and from marble
itself.</p>

<p>The art of stone-polishing on a small scale is a very pretty one, and not at all
difficult to get up to. I mentioned a vice to hold the work, but a wooden contrivance
like what you may see on a carpenter&#8217;s bench will do even better. If you have an
iron vice, and determine to use it, you must roll your work partially up in old canvas
or leather, else the iron will scratch it.</p>

<p>In the art of polishing either stone, shell, or horn, any boy may soon become an
adept. It is not half so difficult as it at first appears, only hard work, energy, and
perseverance are most certainly required.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX.&mdash;BRITISH PEBBLES.<br />
<span class="smcap">By the Rev. A. N. Malan, M.A., F.G.S.</span></h3>

<h4 class="fsize80">I.&mdash;THE PEBBLES AND HOW TO FIND THEM.</h4>

<p class="noindent">An endless variety of delights can be enjoyed by the sea. Bathing, boating, fishing,
paddling, building sand-castles and forts, engineering experiments in canals
and ponds, prawning, shrimping, collecting shells, anemones, and seaweeds, sailing
toy-boats, cricket and tennis on the sands. Well, now, you boys who love the
pleasures of the seaside, my purpose here is to introduce a new attraction to your
notice. The amusement we are going to bring before you possesses more solid and
lasting attractions. What say you to <span class="smcapall">PEBBLE-HUNTING</span> as a seaside recreation?</p>

<p>Pebble-hunting is a resource calculated to excite high enthusiasm. It brings us
into familiarity with some of the most beautiful objects in Nature. Pebbles can be
obtained free of expense. Nature&#8217;s inexhaustible treasure-house is always open.
She invites you to approach and help yourself at will. She offers with unstinting
hand stones of imperishable beauty. It is ungracious to scorn her liberality.</p>

<p>We propose, then, to give particulars of British pebbles&mdash;how to recognise those
worth collecting, where to look for them, and how to cut and polish them for
yourselves. No writer for boys, so far as I know, has ever yet given practical
instructions about cutting and polishing stones. The best pebble unpolished looks
dull and dead. The polishing brings out its beauty and makes it a lasting treasure.
The polishing is nothing else than <i>rubbing the pebble smooth</i>. A flint pebble is so
hard that when rubbed perfectly smooth it reflects light just as glass and water do.
Nothing is put on to make the surface shine, as in polishing wood. The pebble is merely
<i>rubbed smooth</i>; and when this is done, the surface proves to be so hard that no instrument
of the hardest steel, not even a file, will produce upon it the faintest scratch.
I am speaking of flint-pebbles or agates, which are to be found upon many beaches.</p>

<p>The first difficulty is, <i>how to recognise the good pebbles</i>, as they lie amid the
countless host of less interesting stones. I often hear the question, &#8216;Can you tell
what a pebble will be like inside before you cut it?&#8217; The answer is &#8216;Yes&#8217; and
&#8216;No.&#8217; I can tell so far that I should not labour at cutting and polishing an
obviously worthless stone; but, alas! often a stone which gives good promise on
the outside proves uninteresting when cut, and so is laid aside on the shelf as an
example of unrequited toil not worth any further trouble. This is inevitable. But,
far from being a discouragement, such disappointments only serve to stimulate the
zeal and sharpen the faculties in discriminating the real prizes.</p>

<p>We must not start with an idea of finding gems upon our beaches. These
exquisite objects are exotics, natives principally of dark mines and sunny strands
in the far East. The diamond, sapphire, ruby, topaz, peridot, emerald, beryl,
tourmaline, turquois, chrysolite, garnet, and precious opal, are not for us.
The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
magnificent agates of India and Brazil are familiar to us when artificially stained
and manufactured into bracelets, brooches, penholders, &amp;c., and exhibited in the
jewellers&#8217; shops. Splendid specimens in their natural tints may be seen cut and
polished in the Geological Museum, Jermyn Street, in the Natural History Museum,
Cromwell Road, and elsewhere. But we shall never find such stones on our own beaches.</p>

<p>Oriental and Brazilian pebbles are not unfrequently palmed off upon innocent
and unsuspecting visitors as the genuine products of some favoured beach within
her Majesty&#8217;s British Dominions. A lady once told me that she picked up in a
week a quantity of splendid onyxes at a watering-place&mdash;let us call it Rocksands&mdash;and
had them ground and polished into a necklace of beads. Another showed me
a beautiful brown onyx, set in gold, which she found (?) in the same neighbourhood.
A third assured me that a friend of hers had picked up amethysts and topazes on the
same beach. This was at the time when I first began to take an interest in pebbles.
The summer holidays were approaching. My portmanteau was packed; I was off to
Rocksands.</p>

<p>The long journey was at last accomplished, and the omnibus set me down at the
Royal Hotel; when three steps and a jump landed me upon the famous beach. It
was crowded with persons of both sexes and all ages. I never saw so many backs
bending at one time for the same purpose. They carried baskets, which gradually
groaned under the weight of minerals amassed. For three days I joined the glad throng,
comparing notes with many treasure-seekers, and collected some hundred and fifty
stones possessing better pretensions to celebrity than the obviously worthless
specimens.</p>

<p>I took them to one of the lapidary establishments. They are so kind at
Rocksands in looking over visitors&#8217; findings and pronouncing upon their merits.
The lapidary establishment was crowded. At last my turn came. With beating
heart I displayed my beach upon the counter. &#8216;Oh yes; that&#8217;s a fine red carnelian;
that&#8217;s an onyx, that&#8217;s a topaz; that&#8217;s a mocha stone; that&#8217;s a weed-agate. If you&#8217;ll
come on Saturday they shall be ready.&#8217;</p>

<p>I came, and received some beautiful foreign agates, cut and polished ready for
brooches, such as are imported wholesale from Germany, where they work the
lapidary-wheels by water-power, and prepare the foreign stones at small cost. At
any seaside place, in the attractive shops on the esplanade, you can buy for a
shilling a magnificent onyx or agate brooch. It cost me from two shillings to half-a-crown
each to have my Rocksands treasures cut and polished! And what were
the stones which I actually took to the lapidary? Nothing else than absolute
rubbish&mdash;pebbles of coarse quartz, slate, and porphyry!</p>

<p>Some years after this a gentleman living at Rocksands collected a number of
stones, principally &#8216;amethysts and carnelians,&#8217; as he was told. He forwarded me
two of his finest specimens. They were pebbles of inferior quartz, but I cut and
polished them to convince him, and his eyes were opened to the truth. Another
forwarded me a stone which had been in his possession for years, prized and
habitually shown to friends as most valuable. I wrote back, &#8216;You found that stone
at Rocksands, and were told that it was an amethyst. It is not worth stooping to
pick up!&#8217; He replied that I was correct in the locality, but asked me to cut and
polish it, notwithstanding the unflattering verdict. I did so, and his eyes
were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
likewise opened. Lapidaries are not, as a class, unprincipled, but some of them seem
to find it hard to resist the temptation of imposing upon the simplicity of the public.</p>

<p>A few words about the topaz and amethyst. They belong to the magnificent
sapphire group, very precious and exquisite crystals of alumina. Never by any
possibility will such stones be found upon our beaches, unless some eccentric person
sows them. They are Oriental gems, and I believe they have never been found in
England. But there are crystals of quartz (pure flint) which closely resemble in
colour and transparency the true topaz and amethyst. Such crystals are found on a
large scale in cavities of rocks and mountains&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, in the &#8216;druses&#8217; of the Alps.
There are splendid crystals of smoky-brown and straw-coloured quartz found in the
Grampian Mountains, known as &#8216;cairn-gorms.&#8217; Now there is no reason why
fragments of such crystals should not be found upon a beach rounded into pebbles,
but I do not believe they have ever actually been found in England. A letter in a
London daily paper some time ago stated that such amethysts were common in some
parts of Ireland. It would be more correct to speak of them as pebbles of amethystine
quartz. I have some good specimens of Irish amethysts from the Island of Achill.
The so-called amethysts of Rocksands have no pretensions even to transparency.</p>

<p>If I were to tell you that in Cornwall they mend the roads with amethysts you
might smile. But it is not so very far from the truth. I have a piece of granite
picked up on a new-laid Cornish road full of beautiful crystals of amethystine quartz.
The lady pebble-seekers and others might do well to travel west!</p>

<p>The pebbles we really do hope to find are moss-agates, ring-agates, chalcedonies,
carnelians, choanites and other fossil-zoophytes, jaspers, conglomerates, shell-agates,
variegated flints, and beetle-stones. There are besides large flint &#8216;geodes&#8217; containing
beautiful crystals of quartz, caskets of jewels from the chalk strata, but
these are not suitable for cutting and polishing. It is fine exercise to go out with a
stout hammer &#8216;flint-smashing&#8217; under the cliffs of Beachy Head. Splendid treasures
of crystal are to be found there, but they cannot be improved by artificial treatment.</p>

<p>Cairn-gorms are now very rare. I once made a pilgrimage into the heart of the
Grampians, hoping to find some specimens, but without success. I also spent a
day on the beaches of Loch Tay, having read in a mineralogical book that beautiful
agates are to be obtained there, &#8216;in which the imaginative Highlander sees the
lakes and mountains of his native land.&#8217; There also I had no success; the nearest
approach to agates that I found were fragments of old glass bottles; and I returned
with the melancholy conviction that those bottles, when entire, must have contained
a certain spirituous liquor dear to the heart of the &#8216;imaginative Highlander,&#8217; under
the influence of which his imagination was excited to set a false value upon the
&#8216;chuckey stones&#8217; at his feet.</p>

<p>A few simple definitions will assist progress. <i>Chalcedony</i> is a form of very pure
translucent flint, often also transparent, sometimes tinted with delicate shades of
blue, purple, pink, orange or brown. <i>Choanite</i> is the name given to a fossil-zoophyte
of the sea-anemone class, with central funnel-shaped body (&#8216;choanos&#8217; is
Greek for a funnel), and tentacles radiating from every part. <i>Moss-agate</i> is the
pretty name given to chalcedonic pebbles, containing moss-like ramifications in
various colours&mdash;pink, blue, black, orange, red, and yellow&mdash;due to the presence
of metallic oxides, and often, no doubt, to the actual colouring matter of
some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
zoophyte round which the pebble originally formed. <i>Conglomerate pebbles</i> contain
fragments of chalcedony, flint, etc., embedded in a matrix of different character,
presenting an appearance somewhat resembling almond-rock. <i>Translucent</i>, transmitting
light, <i>but not</i> the outlines or colours of objects behind it. <i>Transparent</i>,
transmitting light, <i>and also</i> the outlines and colours of objects behind the light.</p>

<p>Some of the best hunting-grounds for pebbles are the beaches of our south
coast. Taking the map, we may notice in order Dover, Folkestone, New Romney,
Dungeness, Hastings, Eastbourne, Brighton, Worthing, Bognor, Littlehampton; in
the Isle of Wight&mdash;Sandown, Shanklin, and Ventnor: the Chesil Beach, Seaton,
and Sidmouth. Here are plenty of shingly beaches for you to choose from, and
chalcedonic pebbles are common upon them all. So let us take a ramble, it does
not much matter where.</p>

<p>Suppose we select the Chesil Beach, the most extensive accumulation of shingle
in the British Isles. There is room to breathe under the frowning heights of
Portland Bill, and the sea is so grand! If you wish to be impressed with the
majesty of Nature, walk on the Chesil Beach after a fresh gale from the south-west,
and the grandeur of the sea will be before you in all the magnificence of its strength.</p>

<p>Here we are! What a wonderful sight! The sea on both sides; nine miles of
terraced shingle stretching in a great curve right away west to Bridport Harbour.
Millions multiplied by millions of rounded pebbles! How can we possibly find the
beauties among such an infinite host? The prospect is indeed vast, almost
bewildering. But we will at once circumscribe the portion of beach to be searched.
The sea fortunately happens to be calm, and the tide is ebbing. We will confine
our attention to the narrow strip just out of reach of the waves, which is not yet
dried by the sun. It is a great advantage to hunt upon a <i>wet</i> beach, because the
colours and characters of the pebbles are more vividly shown when they are wet
than when they are dry.</p>

<p>Now, then, keep your eyes open. You need not stoop. Walk upright, shoulders
well back, head merely inclined forward, and eyes as sharp as a ferret&#8217;s. You must
not get round-shouldered by pebble-hunting, or what will the drill-sergeant say?
There is no necessity to stoop at all, except to pick up a stone.</p>

<p>See, there lies one almost transparent. You could not help noticing it. Pick it
up and hold it to the light. See its pure, delicate, lustrous substance, a pale grey
tint. That is chalcedony&mdash;pure flint. Look at it carefully. Now you know the
kind of &#8216;stuff&#8217; we are looking for. It is so clear and glassy, such a perfect oval
shape, that it seems a shame to pitch it into the sea. Yet we cannot afford to keep
it, for if we once began putting the clear chalcedonies into the bag, it would be
filled in a hundred yards.</p>

<p>&#8216;But why,&#8217; you ask, &#8216;if this is a chalcedony, pure and perfect, must we throw it
away?&#8217; Because it is <i>too perfect</i>! It would merely resemble dull glass if cut and
polished. There is no <i>incidental beauty</i> about it, no variety of colour and texture,
no trace of any animal organism in it. It is too pure. We want the same article
adulterated, so to speak, by Nature&#8217;s handicraft. We want to find the same
substance containing some exquisite workmanship. We want to find such a pebble
with some &#8216;fruit&#8217; enclosed; just as a child wants the piece of jelly containing the
imprisoned strawberry, and prefers that to any other portion in the dish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>Try now to find a pebble of the <i>same character</i> with traces of colouring and
marking. How beautiful the wet pebbles are! All colours&mdash;brown, red, yellow,
orange, pale blue, pink, purple, black, white; any colour except green; that is the
rarest of all.</p>

<p>Now here is a pebble, part of chalcedony, part of baser flint; the chalcedony
tinted red and orange. Look closely into it. Notice those &#8216;feelers&#8217; delicately
spread, like those of a sea-anemone in a pool. Notice the central body, like the eye
of a daisy. You see at a glance that this is a choanite. When cut and polished
this stone is certain to be a pleasing specimen. It is a good shape; the choanite
is so well displayed; there are no serious cracks or flaws in the stone. Those are
the points in deciding upon the merits of choanites.</p>

<p>We might make either a cross-section or longitudinal section of it, or polish it
all over. However we treat it, it is sure to prove an attractive specimen. Notice
that portion where the feelers have disappeared, decomposed, it would seem, during
the process of &#8216;silicification,&#8217; or conversion into flint. The <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the feelers has
become &#8216;moss,&#8217; and the beautiful tints are probably due to the actual colouring of
the creature itself. They are too delicate for iron oxides.</p>

<p>Now let us look again. No; that is merely a common flint variegated with
stains of iron. No; that one is no use; nothing organic in it. No, nor that
either. Oh! you must not be discouraged; Rome was not built in a day. The
excitement of hope, the expectation of finding beautiful treasures, should prevent your
getting weary of search, and it will when you have found a few really good stones.</p>

<p>Your eyes will soon be trained to detect the prizes. It merely wants a little
practice and patience, and, when the knowledge is attained, what a new world is
opened up! Amid the crowd of loungers bending over every pool and rock, poking
with the aimless end of an umbrella or walking-stick, picking up occasionally a bit
of seaweed or a shell, you pass along unnoticed, and under their very eyes you
pounce upon a real treasure&mdash;aye, and actually valuable. I was offered ten shillings
the other day by a professional lapidary for a stone I found, just as it was picked
up. Even if some days may prove unprofitable, still the enthusiasm of hope will
buoy you up. The trout-fisher never despairs, though sometimes he returns home
with creel almost empty.</p>

<p>There, now! You have found a genuine moss-agate. Let us sit down and
examine it closely. Notice that half of the stone is coarse muddy flint, but the
other half is chalcedony of a red-purple tint. See these indications of &#8216;moss,&#8217;
black and orange, of beautiful and delicate texture, floating in the chalcedony.
Wet the pebble again to make its beauty more vivid. Look hard at it. Look into
its translucent depths. Get familiar with that &#8216;solidified jelly,&#8217; for when you
thoroughly understand its appearance you have the key to the whole beach. The
chalcedonic pebbles, when decorated with coloured markings, are called &#8216;agates.&#8217;
If they contain moss-like markings, they are moss-agates.</p>

<p>Often in a moss-agate we find evident remains of tentacles, proving that when
the pebble was born it contained some zoophyte or sea anemone kind of creature,
which in the process of silicification was decomposed. The substance of these agates
must once have been a semi-fluent jelly like thick syrup. Perhaps the silicon was
plentifully dissolved in the sea water; we cannot tell. It is a mystery of
science<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
not yet explained, therefore look with reverence upon this stone. You hold in your
hand one of God&#8217;s secrets. Look at the choanite again which we found just now.
That creature once lived, so frail as almost to melt in the sun when left, perhaps,
on the rocks by the ebbing tide. And God has caused it to be caught in the
embrace of adamantine flint, to rescue it from dissolution, and preserve it as an
object of immortal beauty. The wonderful, unspeakable transformation was enacted
in the waters of ocean far back in unknown ages, and the only clue to its mystery
lies in that verse of the Psalm: &#8216;Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did He in the
earth, and in the sea, and in all deep places.&#8217;</p>

<p>Choanites always seem to me to speak eloquently of a Resurrection to a glorious
state after death. I think of them living their humble life in ages before man
appeared on this earth, clinging to rocks in unknown seas, waving their delicate
arms with the movement of the waves, gathering the food brought within their
reach by the beneficent hand of Him who takes thought for the meanest of His
creatures. Nothing could seem less probable, than that these frail creatures should
be preserved from destruction in death. God teaches us by them that He who has
the power of life and death can stay the progress of corruption in the frailest bodies.
They rise, as it were, from the dead after thousands of years, clothed in greater
beauty and interest than they ever possessed in life. We should, perhaps, have
shrunk from touching them when alive, but as found in their caskets of purest flint
they are &#8216;laid with fair colours,&#8217; and form objects of exquisite beauty. Thus we
see them emerge from the grave in glorified form after a death of centuries. God,
who ministered to their wants in life, also brought it about that their fragile bodies
should not see corruption. He has given them immortal beauty, and by them He
teaches us that He is able to deal in like manner with our own perishable bodies.
Sown in corruption, they shall be raised in incorruption: sown in dishonour, they
shall be raised in glory.</p>

<p class="blankbefore"><span class="smcap">Choanites and Moss-Agates!</span> If you only have patience and perseverance,
you are sure to find specimens every time you take a good ramble along a shingly
beach that has any likelihood of treasure. Some, of course, will be better than
others. Experience will make you fastidious in taste. You will reject those that
seem inferior in shape, or damaged and imperfect. Practice will soon teach you.
Take your pebbles to a lapidary, if there is one in the town. Weymouth, unfortunately,
does not boast one; but there are some at Brighton, I believe, and Hastings. At
Worthing there is Mr. Dowsett, opposite the pier; at Eastbourne there is Mr.
Hollobon, who has made one of the most magnificent collections of pebbles to be
seen anywhere in England, all found, cut, and polished by himself during twenty-five
years of labour and research. At Sidmouth there are three lapidaries. At Ventnor
there is Mr. Billings, to whom, I think, the palm must be assigned as the most
enterprising and skilful of the fraternity.</p>

<p>Take your stones, whenever you have the opportunity, to one of these; he will
tell you whether they are worth polishing, and polish one for you at a small cost, if
you wish, the charge being about sixpence a square inch. And more than that, he
will show you really good stones, and tell you where they were found, and encourage
you, if he sees you really interested in the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>There are other varieties of these fossil-agates, but the popular names are not
worth much. You may call them all agates, and collect specimens of every variety
with a view to their intrinsic beauty; and you may try and imagine what the creatures
were like, and hunt them up in books as you proceed.</p>

<p>Let us leave the Chesil Beach and speed in a flash of thought some six hundred
miles, right away to Montrose, N.B. We cross the estuary by the ferry, and walk
down towards the lighthouse. Those low rocks are basaltic, or trap. In them we
find a totally different class of agates&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ring-agates</span>: see them sticking like plums
in a cake. With hammer and chisel we can knock out as many as we please.
Many prove hollow when cut, ceiled and paved with beautiful quartz-crystals. But
others have the exquisite ringed formation, and the delicacy of the concentric bands
is full of wonder. Among the rocks farther down the coast we can pick up numbers
already separated from their rocky cavities by the disintegrating processes of sea
and weather. I collected 300 in three days.</p>

<p>It is probable that the cavities in which they occur were formed by gases escaping
when the soft rock was growing solid&mdash;just as cavities are formed in bread. Then
water charged with silicious deposit filtered into the cavities. But no satisfactory
explanation of the beautiful parallel banding has yet been set forth. Once more we
are confronted by a Divine secret. In these cavities&mdash;deep places&mdash;the Lord did
whatsoever He pleased.</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">II.&mdash;THE LAPIDARY&#8217;S BENCH.</h4>

<p>The lapidary&#8217;s bench is a very simple arrangement, as can be seen from a glance
at the sketch (<a href="#FigXXX01">fig. 1</a>). There is no complicated machinery about it. All that is
required is to turn a circular plate of lead or other material with mechanical advantage.
For the rest, it is hard work with the coat off and the sleeves tucked up.
Plenty of &#8216;elbow grease,&#8217; energy, perseverance, and the determination to overcome
difficulties. Therefore the art of polishing pebbles may exert a beneficial influence in
strengthening the muscles and the character of a true Englishman.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXX01">
<img src="images/illo321a.jpg" alt="bench" width="400" height="498" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>My bench, as <a href="#FigXXX01">drawn</a> on the opposite page, was made and furnished with the
requisite apparatus by Mr. Moore, 1, Clerkenwell Green, E.C., at the cost of &pound;5.
Any carpenter would probably make the bench from the description we shall now
give at the cost of &pound;1; and a practical blacksmith could easily manage the metallic
fittings. But if you are expert in the simple processes of carpentry you had much
better get the wood and make a bench for yourself.</p>

<p>We will describe the bench most carefully, giving all necessary dimensions.</p>

<p>Floor of bench (<span class="smcapall">A B C</span>) is made of seasoned deal
1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. thick. From <span class="smcapall">A</span> to <span class="smcapall">B</span> the
length is 3 ft. 8 in. From <span class="smcapall">B</span> to
<span class="smcapall">C</span> the breadth is 2 ft. Back, sides, and partition are
of <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. deal. Breadth of front board
(<span class="smcapall">A B</span>) is 3 in.; of back board (<span class="smcapall">V C</span>) 6 in. The
legs and cross-bars are of stout deal 3 in. by 2 in. Height from <span class="smcapall">A</span> to floor of room
is 3 ft. If that is too high for you stand on a stool to work, but do not make the
bench any lower, because in time you will grow taller, and the bench will not.
From <span class="smcapall">D</span> to floor of room 1 ft. From <span class="smcapall">E</span> to floor of room 2 ft.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXX02">
<img src="images/illo321b.jpg" alt="strap" width="300" height="117" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>

<p>The large iron wheel (<span class="smcapall">W</span>) is 1 ft. 10 in. in diameter, fixed on an iron spindle,
turned with the left hand by a curved crank (<span class="smcapall">H</span>) 7 in. long,
and handle (<span class="smcapall">N</span>) of any
wood nicely turned and fitted comfortably for the hollow of the hand to embrace
it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
The strap (<span class="smcapall">O</span>) is of leather 1 in. wide, passing
round the reel (<span class="smcapall">G</span>). Its ends are
joined by a simple and effective method shown in <a href="#FigXXX02">Fig. 2</a>. The strap is carefully
measured to requisite length; a nail is
passed through the two ends, and string
wound tightly round the ends behind the
nail and tied. If the strap slackens at all
after much use, it can be readjusted by a
piece of extra string wound tightly round.</p>

<p>Iron spindle (<span class="smcapall">F</span>) 1 ft. 6 in. long, with
&#8216;lap&#8217; (<span class="smcapall">M</span>), screw and nut
(<span class="smcapall">P</span>), reel (<span class="smcapall">G</span>).
Four circular laps will be required, each
with its own spindle, screw, nut, and reel.
The reels must be exactly the same size,
so that the strap may suit them all alike.
One lap is of lead, one of beech wood,
one of pewter, one of deal with two layers
of common felt strained over and neatly
fastened with tacks on the under-side. Each
lap is 10 in. in diameter, 1 in. thick at the
edge, gradually sloping up to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. towards
centre. Spindles 1 in. square, rounded to
sharp points at both ends. Reels 2 in. in
diameter, of elm or box, fixed 3 in. from
lower point of spindles. The laps are
screwed on the spindles as shown in <a href="#FigXXX01">Fig. 1</a>,
where all measurements are given.</p>

<p>There is a circular hole in the floor of the bench to allow spindle and reel to
pass in and out, 4 in. in diameter. The clamp (<span class="smcapall">I</span>) rises 13 in. above the floor of the
bench, and is screwed into position by movable nut underneath.
The movable arm (<span class="smcapall">K L</span>) is raised or lowered at will, and adjusted
by screw and nut (<span class="smcapall">Q</span>). Length of arm from
<span class="smcapall">K</span> to <span class="smcapall">L</span> is 7<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. A
block of lignum vit&aelig; (<span class="smcapall">R</span>) is
inserted in arm. Blocks of
the same wood are screwed on at <span class="smcapall">S</span> and <span class="smcapall">T</span> for
the points of the spindles to work on. These
points should be very sharp and only just
&#8216;bite&#8217; the wood, so that friction may be
diminished as far as possible. When a hole
is worn in the lignum vit&aelig; the spindles can
be shifted to a fresh part.</p>

<p>The spindle of the large iron wheel is
made <i>round</i> at <span class="smcapall">D</span>, <a href="#FigXXX03">Fig. 3</a>, where it works in
the floor of the bench. That hole should
be lined with soft leather, fitting the spindle like a glove, and kept well oiled. An
iron plate (<span class="smcapall">A</span>) keeps the spindle in position. The spindle is, of course, <i>square</i> where
the crank grips it at <span class="smcapall">B</span>, and a nut
(<span class="smcapall">C</span>) screwed tight keeps the crank in position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>The legs of the bench are let into sleepers (<span class="smcapall">X Y</span>, <a href="#FigXXX01">Fig. 1</a>), screwed firmly to the
floor of the room, and clamps at <span class="smcapall">C</span> and elsewhere screwed to the wall of the room
may give additional rigidity. The bench must stand true and fast, so that there
may be no oscillation during work. It should be placed in front of a window, as
plenty of light is desirable.</p>

<p>The following requisites must now be procured. Seven pounds of emery
&#8216;46-hole&#8217;; some fine sifted silver sand; some rottenstone in lumps&mdash;the hardest
is best; some putty powder. Then you will want a housemaid&#8217;s blacklead brush, a
nail brush with handle, a brush used for cleaning silver plate. These should be old
and nearly worn-out. A large earthenware vessel for water to stand on a stool or
table at the right side of the bench within easy reach, and three jampots for water.
You see that the furniture is of the humblest description.</p>

<p>All being now ready, we may hope to commence operations in polishing a
pebble.</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">III.&mdash;HOW TO POLISH A PEBBLE.</h4>

<p>There are three distinct processes in polishing a pebble&mdash;grinding, smoothing,
and facing. Let us take this pebble, a choanite, of a kind which I found at
Sandown, Isle of Wight, and which I polished in the first of the only four lessons
I ever had. It is a beautiful little rounded choanite, rather flattened on the upper
and under surfaces. It is too small to be held comfortably between the thumb
and two first fingers. We must therefore fix it upon a cement-stick. So we must
manufacture some cement as follows. Here is the recipe<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

</div><!--figc510-->

<p>1 lb. of pitch, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> lb. of resin,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> lb. of shellac, 1 oz. of beeswax, must be broken up
and put into a good-sized saucepan. Begin boiling the mixture upon a fire, and as
it boils add gradually 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> lb. of Spanish brown, stirring all the while until all the
ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Pour the contents of the saucepan upon the
stone flags of the kitchen floor, or any pavement, in portions a foot in diameter.
When cold remove the cement by a kitchen knife inserted underneath. Make
some pieces of wood 4 in. long according to the shape in <a href="#FigXXX04">Fig. 4</a>, and melt on them
a portion of cement as shown at <span class="smcapall">B</span>. A nail driven
into the wood at <span class="smcapall">A</span> and <span class="smcapall">C</span> will
strengthen the cement. Fashion the cement into shape with the fingers well wetted.
Warm the stone, and again melt the cement over a candle. Apply it to the stone,
and work it on with the fingers. Be sure you have the stone firmly fixed. To test
it, plunge the stone and stick into water, and when it is cool see if you can pull
the stone off. The diagrams in <a href="#FigXXX05">Fig. 5</a> show the phases of
cementing a stone. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
the stone is insecure, pull it off, and warm and melt up again. Practice makes
perfect.</p>

<p>The first stage is that of <span class="smcapall">GRINDING</span>. Set up the <i>lead</i> lap as shown in the
drawing of the bench (<a href="#FigXXX01">Fig. 1</a>). Put a heap of emery in the left corner of the right
compartment (<span class="smcapall">J</span>). Put a jam-pot of water at <span class="smcapall">Z</span>. Take the old blacklead brush,
dip it in water, mix up some emery with it into a paste; wet the lap; brush it well
over with emery. Take your cemented stone in the right hand, between the thumb
and two first fingers; turn the handle <span class="smcapall">N</span> slowly from right to left, and as the lap
revolves press the stone upon it. Grind away, understanding that you want to
grind down all irregularities on the surface of the pebble. Try and throw the
weight of the body through the right arm and wrist into the pebble. Emery is
harder than flint. The pressure forces the emery into the lead lap, and so its
surface is converted into a powerful rasp. Pause at intervals to brush fresh emery
over the wheel. &#8216;Don&#8217;t spare your emery!&#8217; was an exhortation I often heard when
receiving my lesson. Do not attempt to do the whole surface of the pebble at
once. Begin at a corner and finish it fairly, and so pass on to adjacent parts.
Work towards the <i>centre</i> of the lap when grinding <i>round</i> surfaces, and keep the
flat margin of the lap for flat stones.</p>

<p>Ah, your right hand begins to ache as it never ached before! You must not
mind. Rest a while, and then at it again! You are bringing muscles into play
which are unaccustomed to the work, and the strain will be felt until the muscles
are strengthened by the exercise. Keep washing the pebble at intervals with the
nail brush in the earthen vessel to see how the work progresses.</p>

<p>The surface of the pebble where you have been working now looks smooth, and
the feelers of the choanite are vividly shown. Finish in the same manner the
whole surface. Feel that you bring the weight of the arm&mdash;and even of the body&mdash;to
play through the wrist of the right hand upon your stone. Do not forget the
emery and washing, and see that you keep the surface of the stone true and free
from &#8216;ridges&#8217; and &#8216;shoulders.&#8217;</p>

<p>When you think the surface is sufficiently ground, then continue working on the
lead <i>without putting on any more emery</i>. Continue patiently so grinding until the
lap works perfectly free from grit, and the emery on it has been reduced to soft
black paste. This will make the surface of your pebble much smoother. The
nearer you reach perfection in this first stage the easier will be the afterwork. If
you continue long enough the stone will look half polished when <i>dry</i> before you
have finished. <i>Dry</i> the stone periodically to estimate progress, remembering that a
pebble always looks polished when <i>wet</i>.</p>

<p>We may suppose now that you have completed the first process, so we pass on
to the second.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smoothing.</span>&mdash;Lift off the strap by <i>raising</i> the part nearest to you off the
wheel, and let the strap lie loose upon it. The strap consequently falls off
the reel. Unscrew <span class="smcapall">Q</span>. Raise the arm <span class="smcapall">K L</span>, which remains raised by its own weight.
Lift the lead lap carefully out and put it aside. Set up the beech wood lap
instead. Use another jam-pot of water at <span class="smcapall">Z</span>, and see that no emery-grit gets upon
the wood lap. Dip your right hand in water and thoroughly wet the surface of
the lap while it slowly revolves. Then dip the wet fingers in sifted
silver-sand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
and rub them over the wood, and proceed as you did in the first process of
grinding.</p>

<p>Our aim now is to <i>smooth</i> the surface of the stone, to carry to higher perfection
the work of the emery. Do not go too fast, and keep the stone and lap well wetted,
otherwise the heat caused by friction will crack the surface of the stone. Many a
beautiful stone has been spoilt in this way. Do not use much sand. Wash and
examine the pebble as you go on. See how beautiful it is getting to look! How
wonderfully the texture and organism have been brought out by the smoothing!
Make the work as perfect as you can upon the wood, and continue working your
pebble without putting on any sand, until the wood seems free from grit. In the
last stage of this smoothing process we work the stone almost entirely on moist
wood, as the sand has been reduced to powder. Wipe the stone dry, and if you are
satisfied that you cannot do anything more for it on the wood, we may pass on to
the third process of <i>facing</i> the pebble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Facing.</span>&mdash;As before, remove the wood lap. And now we must proceed with
extreme caution. We are going to set up the pewter lap. Bear in mind that <span class="smcapall">ONE
GRAIN OF SAND OR EMERY UPON THE PEWTER WILL RUIN YOUR WORK</span>! The floor
of the bench is covered with <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of sand and emery; there is a heap of emery in
the corner. How can you possibly prevent catastrophe? Care and practice will
bring success. Remember the caution, and you will do your best to keep clear of
disaster. First of all sweep up the emery into a heap at <span class="smcapall">J</span>, keeping it well away
from the vicinity of the lap. Thoroughly wipe the handle <span class="smcapall">N</span>,
the clamp <span class="smcapall">I</span>, and the
arm <span class="smcapall">K L</span>&mdash;everything that could bring a speck of grit upon the
pewter. Shut the window, that no wandering breeze may work
mischief. Wash your hands in a bowl of clean water, and put the
bowl in place of the earthen vessel. Jam-pot of clean water at <span class="smcapall">Z</span>.
Now set up the pewter lap. The first thing is to &#8216;notch&#8217; the
surface of the lap, that it may hold the rottenstone. This is done
by holding a table-knife lightly by the handle in the right hand, and
letting the edge of the knife play upon the surface of the lap as
you slowly turn the handle <span class="smcapall">N</span> from right to left, and then from
left to right. The result of this is to set up a &#8216;bibbering&#8217; movement in the
knife&mdash;such as you may notice in the bow when a nervous young lady is performing
upon the violin. The surface of the pewter will soon be decorated, as in <a href="#FigXXX06">Fig. 6</a>, with
markings not unlike the pattern on the case of a watch. When this is done wash
the surface of the lap by dipping the fingers of the right hand in clean water. Take
a lump of rottenstone, thoroughly washed and free from grit, and press it on the
pewter while slowly revolving. The rottenstone is conveyed as a brown paste to
the surface of the pewter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXX06">
<img src="images/illo324.png" alt="pewter" width="250" height="247" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 6.</p>
</div>

<p>Now scrub the pebble, cement and stick with the plate-brush in the bowl of
water, until you feel certain that no speck of grit lurks in any crevice, and begin
working the pebble on the pewter lap as in the other stages, putting pressure through
the wrist of the right hand, and letting the weight of the arm play, so that a sort
of rhythmical movement is imparted to the pressure difficult to describe, but soon
understood when you see a lapidary at work.</p>

<p>In polishing a round stone you must be careful to avoid producing
&#8216;ridges&#8217; by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
dwelling too long on one spot. Keep on turning the stone slightly. Common
sense will explain my meaning. And in this last stage <span class="smcapall">BE SURE YOU NEVER WIPE
YOUR HANDS OR YOUR STONE WITH THE CLOTH USED FOR THE SAND OR EMERY
STAGE</span>. Use a clean cloth. It took me <i>two years</i> to find out the force of this
simple advice. I could not imagine how it was that just at the last moment, when
I was putting the finishing touches to a pebble, some faint but hideous scratches
would suddenly appear on its surface, ruining the beauty of the work. How many
times have I despaired of success! How often have I written to lapidaries
imploring advice, and feeling that there was some &#8216;wrinkle&#8217; which had purposely
been kept from my knowledge! But perseverance was at last rewarded.</p>

<p>There is no &#8216;dodge&#8217; about it; the whole operation is one of patient labour
and determination. After a little working on the pewter lap at one portion of your
stone, wash and wipe it. That portion ought to be so perfectly polished that when
held slantwise towards the window it reflects the landscape like a looking-glass; and
if your work has been true this result will make your heart leap with delight.
Continue working until the whole surface of the stone is finished. If at the end
portions of it looked blurred, it may be that the texture of the stone is incapable of
a high polish in such places; it may more likely be that you have not been
particular enough in the first and second stages. Nevertheless the result ought to
be encouraging. Your stone ought to be so far polished that you will be proud to
show it to your friends, and say, &#8216;I found and I polished this stone!&#8217;</p>

<p>Probably, if you have carefully followed out my instructions, the result will be
very creditable for a first attempt. And this is all you have a right to expect.</p>

<p>Some lapidaries, after smoothing their stones on the sand lap employ an elm lap
with powdered pumice-stone, and dispense with the pewter lap altogether, facing
the stone on the felt lap with putty powder. This process is advantageous in
polishing stones <i>all over</i>. But on carefully comparing the systems I am convinced
that there is nothing like the pewter and rottenstone for general purposes; though
the felt is advisable for <i>round</i> stones when they are to be polished over the whole
surface. As you proceed you will be able to try experiments at your discretion.</p>

<p>To polish <i>flat</i> surfaces of pebbles we work exactly as we have described, the
only difference being that you work the stone <i>flat</i> on the margin of the laps. If
you thoroughly understand the principle you will find the flat surfaces easier to
manage than the round.</p>

<p>Mussel and other sea-shells, snail-shells, etc., may be polished in the same way&mdash;only
that being soft they will not require the emery lap. Work them on the sand
lap and cloth lap, and a little experience will soon make you proficient in the art.</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">IV.&mdash;HOW TO CUT A PEBBLE.</h4>

<p>We have reserved the process of <span class="smcapall">CUTTING</span> a pebble till the last, because it is
advisable to understand the polishing process first. Many pebbles make most
attractive specimens without being cut, but no pebble looks well after it is cut
unless it be also polished. Therefore the polishing is the first essential, and I hope
you thoroughly comprehend its principles and are enthusiastic about the whole
subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>To <i>cut</i> a pebble, with a view to polishing its inner surface, we want a spindle
and reel as before, fitted with a disc of the thinnest soft iron. These discs are of
particular make, and must be procured from a practised maker. You should get
six of them, ten inches in diameter, from Mr. Oxley, 83, Caledonian Road,
Islington, <span class="smcapall">N</span>. The shoulder for the disc to rest on should be about five inches from
the upper point of the spindle, and the nut must be screwed home very tight to
keep the disc in position. The disc is &#8216;panned,&#8217; <i>i.e.</i>, beaten into a saucer-shape so
shallow as to be hardly perceptible to the eye. This precaution is necessary to
ensure the edge of the disc being true, for otherwise it would be impossible to make
such thin iron free from undulations in the edge.</p>

<p>The discs are by no means cut true when sent down, and as they must be
brought to absolute perfection of truth before they can be used, the first thing will
be to <i>turn the edge true</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXX07">
<img src="images/illo326.jpg" alt="disc" width="400" height="283" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.</p>
</div>

<p>Procure three small triangular files, sold at fourpence each. Break an inch off
the end of them, and grind them with emery on the lead lap into a pyramidal point
(<a href="#FigXXX07">Fig. 7</a>), with edges as keen as a razor
and point sharp as a needle&#8217;s. Set up
the &#8216;slitter&#8217; (the disc and its spindle)
in position, taking care that it stands
truly perpendicular. Then arrange a
wooden rest underneath the edge of
the disc nearest to you, as shown in
<a href="#FigXXX07">Fig. 7</a>. The support must be securely
fixed, and of the exact height to enable
the disc to revolve upon it. Wet the
edge of the disc, and turn the handle <span class="smcapall">N</span>
with the left hand. Take a file and fix
its point into the wooden rest, so that
a keen edge may catch the edge of the
revolving disc. This will take off a
shaving of iron wherever it bites, and by degrees the edge of the disc will be
turned true, and continuous shavings will curl off it. There is nothing difficult
about this. It requires a neat hand, and you may want to use three files before
finishing; but when you understand that you require the edge of the disc to be
perfectly true you will soon attain the result; and by lightly applying the file to
the upper and under surface of the edge of the disc you will remove any roughness
caused by the turning, and the disc will be ready for use.</p>

<p>Remove the wooden support. Put a common plate under the slitter to catch
the paraffin, which will shortly require notice.</p>

<p>The disc has now to be <span class="smcapall">CHARGED WITH DIAMOND</span>. This sounds somewhat
alarming, but take courage. Diamond &#8216;bort&#8217; consists of genuine diamonds
not sufficiently good to be used for gems. It may be bought of any of the
ordinary merchants at a cost of about six shillings the carat. That amount
would be enough to cut about twelve or fourteen pebbles an inch and a half
in diameter. This is the only serious expense when once the bench has been
set up and furnished. And after all it is not very formidable. Take a fragment
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
bort, and crush it upon a piece of hard steel by means of a steel rod one inch in
diameter and six inches in length. Put the bort on the steel plate; smear a little
butter over the bort to prevent the broken pieces flying away. Hold the steel rod
upon it, and give it a smart blow with a hammer. This crushes the diamond.
Then pound it into the smallest possible powder, using the steel rod as a pestle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXX08">
<img src="images/illo328.jpg" alt="cutting table" width="600" height="321" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 8.</p>
</div>

<p>Now pour some paraffin into a saucer (<span class="smcapall">J</span>,
<a href="#FigXXX08">Fig. 8</a>), and with a feather smear paraffin
over the edge of the disc revolving slowly. Take some of the powdered diamond
on the forefinger of the right hand, and very carefully transfer it to the edge of the
disc. The entire edge must in this way be anointed with crushed diamond-dust.
Then a smooth pebble is taken in the right hand (the hand resting comfortably on
a support <span class="smcapall">G</span>), and <i>pressed</i> against the edge of the disc revolving. Let us understand
exactly the object and action of this. The diamond-powder is the <i>hardest</i> known
substance in Nature; the disc is of <i>soft</i> iron; the flint pebble is very <i>hard</i>. By the
process just described we <i>press the diamond-powder into the substance of the disc</i>, so
that the edge becomes armed with grains of adamant; the edge becomes a mighty
file, or an irresistible saw. The principle is so simple. When you have driven
sufficient diamond-powder into the edge of the disc, you have invested the iron with
an armature which can cut through every hard substance that exists in Nature
except the diamond itself. The hardest flint, emery, iron, glass, metals, etc., must
all bow beneath its mighty power. I should like to shake hands with the man who
devised this simple and clever method. Before its invention agates kept their
treasures locked in close caskets. The diamond-toothed &#8216;slitter&#8217; has supplied the
key for unlocking their secret beauty.</p>

<p>Well, now, the disc is <span class="smcapall">CHARGED</span>, and if you wish to proceed like most of the
lapidaries do, you will take the pebble you wish to cut between the forefinger and
the thumb of the right hand, letting it rest on the second and third fingers. You
will place the support in position, that the hand may rest comfortably upon it when
holding the pebble against the disc; and you will begin turning with the left hand.
You will soon see that the disc has begun to cleave its path. A distinct cut is
visible. You must keep feeding the edge with paraffin by means of the feather;
and as, unfortunately, you have not got a third hand, you must hold the feather
between your teeth, or else get a friend to do the turning. It ought to take about
half an hour to cut an inch through a pebble two inches in diameter. The disc
will have to be re-charged with diamond occasionally, which may be done by using
the slit of the pebble you are cutting as a &#8216;charger.&#8217;</p>

<p>Such is the method of cutting in vogue among most lapidaries. It answers
very well for professionals, but it certainly presents more than one objection to
amateurs. I found the objections so weighty that it required no small determination
to persevere. First of all, it is very difficult to <i>hold the stone true</i>, so that the
cut shall proceed in the same straight line; then the paraffin and detritus of the
cutting cause such a disagreeable &#8216;mess,&#8217; in which the right hand has to take up
permanent quarters, and the nuisance of feeding the paraffin by holding the feather
in the mouth is very great. Finding these objections a grave impediment to
success, I bethought me of a device I once saw used by a lapidary, and improved
upon it in design, and got a tool made by Mr. Moore, of Clerkenwell, which has
proved the greatest comfort and most complete success, entirely obviating all
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
disagreeables alluded to above. The diagram (<a href="#FigXXX08">Fig. 8</a>) ought to make it clear
to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcapall">A B</span> is a circular steel rod, with shoulder
at <span class="smcapall">B</span>, and screwed underneath, rising
ten inches above floor of bench. It has an arm (<span class="smcapall">C D</span>) moving easily round, which
can be set at any height by screw and nut (<span class="smcapall">E</span>). At <span class="smcapall">D</span> is a hole large enough to
admit the cement-stick with pebble attached. This is held securely by a screw at <span class="smcapall">D</span>.
A string (<span class="smcapall">F</span>) is slipped over the cement-stick just above the pebble, with a weight
attached to the other end. The string passes over a pulley (<span class="smcapall">G</span>) in the opposite side
of the bench. It is obvious that the weighted string will always keep the pebble
with even pressure against the disc. The result is that all difficulty in <i>holding</i> the
pebble is removed. The pressure is constant, and the cut is made perfectly true.
The right hand is now free to manipulate the feather for lubricating the disc, and
you can work without getting a drop of oil upon your fingers. You turn the handle
as briskly as you like. The large wheel multiplies the reel ten times&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, one
revolution of the handle produces ten revolutions of the disc. I often attain a speed
of fifteen hundred revolutions of
the disc in a minute when cutting
a pebble! Keep all points of
friction well oiled, and everything
will go merrily as a marriage bell.
<span class="smcapall">H</span> shows the plate for catching
the drops of paraffin and detritus
from the stone; <span class="smcapall">J</span> shows the saucer
of paraffin. The length of the
arm (<span class="smcapall">C D</span>) is ten inches. When
you want to recharge the disc
with diamond, lift the weight at
end of string, shift the arm and
the stone to the right, feed the edge of the disc with diamond, and drive it in
with a smooth stone as before described.</p>

<p>When your stone is cut through wash the halves, and remove the cement by
heating over a candle. The same cement will do for many stones.</p>

<p>You must be careful not to <i>bend</i> the slitter or spoil its edge. Never put it away
leaning on the disc. Keep it when not in use suspended by two strings, and wipe
off the oil carefully when you put it away.</p>

<p>We have now gone through the various processes of <span class="smcapall">GRINDING</span>, <span class="smcapall">SMOOTHING</span>,
<span class="smcapall">FACING</span>, and <span class="smcapall">CUTTING</span>
pebbles. You have a clear knowledge of &#8216;how it is done.&#8217;
It remains for you to decide whether or not you are to become a practical lapidary.
Remember that it is one thing to know how to work and another thing to put that
knowledge into practice. If you resolve to take up the subject you should certainly
make friends with some working lapidary, and get him to let you watch him at work,
and if possible take a few lessons from him.</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">A POSTSCRIPT.</h4>

<p>Since the foregoing chapter was prepared, W. B. has written to us from Ipswich:
&#8216;I have been very interested in your article on stone polishing. I found, however,
that with two hands free you could work the stone much better; so I bought a
treadle and wheel (1 ft. 6 in. through) together, then for the grindery dovetailed
two boards into one another, and having centred the upright ones, put a hardened
coach-screw in, and turned an elm spindle 2 in. thick, and at one end turned a
series of pulleys. Then at each end I drilled holes and screwed coach-screws in,
after having centred their square heads and drilled a small dent for the other
screws to work on. Next I got some wood &#8220;bobbins,&#8221; turned 5 in. through by
1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. thick at hole on spindle, tapering
to <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. The pulleys, of course, were for
the driving speed, so that by putting the strap on the small one I could drive fast,
and the large one slow.</p>

<p>&#8216;The best of this is you can screw the &#8220;lathe&#8221; to the table, and place the
driving-wheel where you like, provided you lengthen or shorten the strap. I
might add that the cost of the whole thing is under ten shillings.&#8217;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXI.&mdash;GRAPHS AND GRAPH-MAKING.<br />
<span class="smcap">By Theodore Wood.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">Although for the last year or two its popularity has been somewhat on the wane,
there can be no doubt that the copying machine, known by the various titles of
chromograph, hektograph, multigraph, centograph, and others of similar nature, is a
most useful invention, and one which saves an immense amount of labour to all
those who wish to draw out a number of copies of diagrams, plans, circulars, letters,
music, etc., without calling in the assistance of the printer. Drawings, too, may be
traced by those who have no original artistic powers, programmes may be made out
for entertainments, and in a hundred other ways the machine will prove a most
profitable investment. Its chief disadvantage lies in its expense, but as the entire
machine can easily be made at home for a very small cost, this drawback is more
apparent than real.</p>

<p>The process of graph-making is a very simple one, and cannot fail if the
directions which I am about now to give are implicitly followed.</p>

<p>The apparatus required is of a very limited character. First you will want an
old tin biscuit-box, sound as to the corners, and of moderate depth. A saucepan
would answer better still, but as you would probably never get it clean again, I do
not recommend its use. Then you will require a short stick or rod with which to
stir the composition, a spirit-lamp (or a gas-jet will do nearly as well), and a stout
carpet-needle fastened into the end of a wooden handle. Finally, you must have
a shallow tray to hold the composition, and also the ingredients themselves.</p>

<p>The tray must be of metal, and nothing will be better for this purpose than the
lid of your biscuit-box, unless you wish to make a graph of phenomenal proportions.
In that case, of course, you must get an ironmonger to make you a tray of the
required dimensions, and be prepared to add an extra shilling or so to the
necessary outlay. For all ordinary purposes, however, you cannot improve upon
the box-lid.</p>

<p>Now as to the ingredients, which, for a graph of medium size, will be as
follows:&mdash;Glycerine (common), eighteen ounces; water, twelve ounces; sulphate
of barium, six ounces; powdered loaf-sugar, three ounces; Nelson&#8217;s gelatine, three
ounces. The first and the third of these you had better get at a <i>manufacturing</i>
chemist&#8217;s; ordinary druggists are apt to charge rather highly for the former, and do
not keep the latter in stock. Each ought to cost you one penny per ounce.
Nelson&#8217;s gelatine you can procure from almost any respectable grocer at fourpence-halfpenny
per one-ounce packet. The total cost, therefore, of the compound should
not exceed three shillings and twopence.</p>

<p>Everything being in readiness, place the ingredients in your biscuit-box, taking
care that the proportions are measured correctly, and place them on one side for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>four-and-twenty hours&mdash;this
in order to allow them to macerate. Next day you will find
that the gelatine has swollen to a wonderful degree, and has absorbed most of the
water. Still, however, the mixture will be very far from perfect, and in order to
complete it you must have recourse to heat. The best thing that you can do is to
place the box upon the kitchen stove, and there leave it for two or three hours until
the gelatine has melted. Take care, however, that the heat is not too great, or your
composition will probably be spoiled.</p>

<p>Every half-hour or so stir the contents of the box with your stick, in order that
they may thoroughly amalgamate. Lastly, when the whole is reduced to a thick,
creamy-looking liquid, give a final stir, and pour the mixture into your tray, which
you will have placed ready to receive it.</p>

<p>Most likely a number of air-bubbles will be floating on the surface of the liquid.
These you must get rid of at once, or you will never be able to get off a clear and
neat impression.</p>

<p>This part of the business is very easily managed. All that you need do is to
heat your needle to a red heat, and touch each bubble in turn with the point. This
treatment will cause them to burst, and by the time you have destroyed them all the
composition will begin to set. For the next half-hour you must leave it perfectly
undisturbed, upon a level surface, and at the end of that time it will be ready for
use.</p>

<p>If all has gone well, your graph ought now to present the appearance of a pale
yellow slab, yielding and rather clammy to the touch, and with a peculiarly glossy
surface. This gloss will vanish after you have taken off your first impression, but
that you need not trouble about.</p>

<p>When you wish to make use of your machine, write your letter or circular, or
whatever it may be, with the special ink, and take care to make the up and down
strokes as nearly as possible of the same thickness throughout. Let the writing dry,
<i>without blotting it</i>, and then lay the sheet of paper face downwards upon your graph.
Take care that in so doing you get no air-bubbles. If you do the result will be an
uneven impression.</p>

<p>Now rub lightly with your finger over the whole of the paper as it lies upon the
graph, in order to make sure that every part shall be in actual contact with the
composition. Then, after about a minute or so, remove the paper very carefully,
lifting it by one corner, and you will see that a reversed copy of the writing&mdash;a
&#8216;negative,&#8217; in fact&mdash;remains upon the graph.</p>

<p>Without loss of time take another sheet of paper, lay it upon the writing, rub as
before, and remove after four or five seconds. An exact copy of the writing will by
that time have been transferred to it, and by repeating the process you can take any
number of impressions, up to fifty or sixty, that you may happen to want. As soon
as you have printed off a sufficient quantity, wash your graph with <i>cold</i> water,
rubbing lightly with a piece of clean rag until the writing has almost disappeared.
Then dry, and put away until again required for use. If you leave it for any length
of time before washing, the ink will sink deeply into the composition. This will
not matter once or twice, but if you make a practice of allowing it to do so your
graph will in course of time be simply saturated with the ink and will assume a deep
violet hue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>The copies which you will have taken will probably have absorbed some of the
moisture from the graph and curled up into a kind of spiral form. These you can
easily straighten by means of warmth and a little judicious pressure.</p>

<p>After you have used it a few times the surface of your graph will most likely
become rough and uneven and unfit for further service. When this is the case, cut
the composition out of the tray with an old knife and melt it down afresh. When
thoroughly liquid, stir it well, pour it back into the tray, and eradicate the bubbles
as before. Do not melt it down in the tray itself. If you do the glycerine will rise
to the surface for want of proper stirring, and utterly ruin every sheet of paper you
place upon the machine, obliging you to melt down the composition over again
before it can be of the least use.</p>

<p>After melting the mixture some fifteen or twenty times you will find it necessary
to add a little water, and perhaps a small quantity of glycerine also, in order to
replace that which has passed off by evaporation. Be careful not to overdo it,
however, for a very slight error in the proportions of the different ingredients will
render the mixture useless.</p>

<p>Ink you had better buy; it is cheap enough, costing only about ninepence a
bottle, and can be obtained almost of any stationer. You can manufacture it
yourself, of course, by making a saturated solution of one of the aniline dyes
(mauveine is the most powerful), and adding a few drops of glycerine, but, so far as
my own experience goes, the home-made article is never really satisfactory, and does
not give nearly the number of copies yielded by that which is specially supplied.
Always procure violet ink in preference to black or red. It is far more powerful,
and gives better and more numerous impressions.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;If you should happen to spill some of this ink on your fingers, wash
them <i>at once</i>, or you will not be able to remove the stain without considerable trouble.</p>

<p>One word in conclusion. Never put your graph away while wet. If you do,
the composition will absorb the moisture, the proper proportions will be altered, and
before very long you will find that the printing power of your machine will be a
thing of the past.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXII.&mdash;CRYPTOGRAPH, OR CIPHER.<br />
<span class="smcap">By a Naval Surgeon.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">I do not know what first made me take to deciphering cryptograms. I do not
think I have more of the Paul Pry in my nature than most of my neighbours. If,
for example, I saw two lovers whispering together, or heard two people talking
aloud by my side in a language which they mistakingly imagined I was not familiar
with, I would put my fingers in my ears or walk right away rather than listen to a
word of their secret. But seeing a letter in cipher in the &#8216;agony column&#8217; of one of
the dailies always appeared to me to be a kind of challenge to my ingenuity; and,
at sea, I have taken the newspaper directly away to my cabin, and never raised
my head from over it until I had puzzled out the cryptogram.</p>

<p>This would, of course, often be a work of some hours, but it passed the time away,
and that itself is something to an idle sailor. Besides, there was some satisfaction
in knowing that I was the only officer in the mess who could read difficult ciphers;
and there was, too often, a good deal of amusement to be obtained from a perusal
of these secret missives.</p>

<p>Thief often writes to thief, and evil-doer to evil-doer; but the letters are more
often those of lover to lover, and innocent enough too&mdash;aye, and I might add
&#8216;green&#8217; enough, as well as innocent. Each of the two correspondents has a copy
of the alphabet they write in. In this alphabet some other letter or figure is used
for the real one. For example, they might put the first three letters of their
mysterious alphabet thus<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table summary="code">

<tr>
<td class="center">A</td>
<td class="center">&mdash;</td>
<td class="center">G</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="center">B</td>
<td class="center">&mdash;</td>
<td class="center">5</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="center">C</td>
<td class="center">&mdash;</td>
<td class="center">R</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p class="noindent">and so on through it all. Then, if they wanted to write the word &#8216;Cab,&#8217; it would
read &#8216;Rg5&#8217; in the agony column, and who, they wonder, that has not a copy of
their key, can find this out, or know that they have chosen a &#8216;g&#8217; to stand for an
&#8216;a,&#8217; a &#8216;5&#8217; for a &#8216;b,&#8217; an &#8216;r&#8217; for a &#8216;c,&#8217; and so forth.</p>

<p>But simple ciphers, when one letter or figure is substituted for another, are very
easily read. If I saw the following, for instance: &#8216;2ssx 2s 5! 2??tnpo7x gn?ts 2!
W?wwsx6,&#8217; as soon as I glanced my eye over it I should be struck with the triple
recurrence of double letters. Thus, in the first word, there are double S&#8217;s, in the
fourth double marks of interrogation, and in the seventh double W&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Then I would ask the question of myself, &#8216;What are the letters most commonly
doubled in the English language?&#8217; They are the vowels e and o at the beginning of
words; the consonants p, r, l, m, n, in the middle of words; and the letter s
or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
l at the end. The double letters in the word 2ssx I guess as &#8216;E&#8217;s.&#8217; Well, a consonant
would come before them, and what one more natural than &#8216;m.&#8217; &#8216;Mee,&#8217;
and the &#8216;x&#8217; must be &#8216;t.&#8217; &#8216;Meet me;&#8217; and after a little more thinking, puzzling,
and conjecture, we would make out the cipher as &#8216;Meet me by moonlight alone,
my poppets.&#8217; Of course this would not be all the cipher; there would very likely
be several words more, and this would make it all the less difficult to read.</p>

<p>Now take a further illustration, that presented by the &#8216;Language of the Restless
Fays,&#8217; as published some years ago<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXII01">
<img src="images/illo334.png" alt="encrypted poem" width="600" height="318" />
</div>

<p>Here you have two very well-known verses written in the language of the
Restless Fays. It is exactly the same as English, excepting in the forms of its letters.
The Fays have twenty-six distinct positions, one for each letter of the alphabet.
Now, who can read these verses? The first letter is an &#8216;L.&#8217;</p>

<p>Glancing over the verses, we find two of the same Fay that ends the first word
standing together in the second word of the sixth line, and next to the first letter;
they must, therefore, we think, be &#8216;O&#8217;s&#8217; or &#8216;E&#8217;s,&#8217;
but &#8216;O&#8217;s&#8217; do not often end words, so
they must be &#8216;E&#8217;s.&#8217; Down with them as &#8216;E&#8217;s.&#8217; Our first word would now have got
as far as this, &#8216;L . . . l e,&#8217; the dots representing the letters still to be supplied;
the second letter <i>must</i> be a vowel, and the double ones, therefore, consonants.
Now run over the alphabet in your own mind, and see what two consonants are
most likely to make sense before the finals <i>l e</i>. Why two &#8216;T&#8217;s&#8217; would, and an &#8216;I&#8217;
before that completes the word &#8216;Little.&#8217;</p>

<p>Now we have <i>four</i> known letters to begin the battle, so we go over every line
and top the Fays wherever we find them representing &#8216;L&#8217;s,&#8217;
&#8216;I&#8217;s,&#8217; &#8216;T&#8217;s,&#8217; or
&#8216;E&#8217;s.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>&#8217;
But the second words of the third, the fourth, and the eighth lines are precisely the
same. They are words of three letters, and they end in the Fay we call &#8216;E.&#8217;
Now what is the commonest word of three letters in our language ending in &#8216;E&#8217;?
Why &#8216;the,&#8217; to be sure. These little words must be &#8216;the&#8217;s,&#8217; so we mark them so,
and this gives us another letter, namely, &#8216;H.&#8217; Then we mark all our &#8216;H&#8217;s&#8217;&mdash;they
are but few&mdash;and go on again rejoicing; and presently our eagle eye is riveted on
the first word of the fourth line represented by three Fays, one kneeling like a
volunteer, the other standing on his head, and the last touching his left toe, and
we are not slow to notice that the last word in the same line ends with those three
foolish Fays, preceded by an &#8216;L.&#8217; So the second letter of that word must be a
vowel, and it is neither &#8216;E&#8217; nor &#8216;I.&#8217; So it must be &#8216;O&#8217; or &#8216;A.&#8217; But the word
&#8216;and&#8217;&mdash;a very common one&mdash;would with an &#8216;L&#8217; prefixing it make the word &#8216;Land.&#8217;
Hurrah! we have it then. The first word of the line is &#8216;and&#8217;; the last is &#8216;land.&#8217;
And we hasten to put down all the &#8216;N&#8217;s&#8217; and &#8216;A&#8217;s&#8217; and &#8216;D&#8217;s&#8217; in the verses over
the heads of the representative Fays as before.</p>

<p>Glancing over the lines we find we have got nearly all the last word in the
fifth line except the first and the two last letters, thus:&mdash;. I N D N E. . The
two last are the same, two mad little Fays, running apparently for their dear
little lives. Now &#8216;L&#8217;s&#8217; and &#8216;S&#8217;s&#8217; are both common as double terminal letters; but
here the S&#8217;s make sense, and the L&#8217;s would not. The word of course is <i>kindness</i>.</p>

<p>Two more new letters? Why, we are getting on. Down they go.</p>

<p>It isn&#8217;t difficult now to guess the words <i>love</i> and <i>above</i>, and we have <i>Eden</i> and
<i>sand</i> and <i>this</i> clear above us. We see, too, in the verses four words of the same two
Fays each. The first Fay is O, so the second must be F, because it is not N nor H.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;ll go no farther with you in the language of the Restless Fays. It would
only be insulting my readers if I expressed a doubt of their being able to puzzle out
the absent letters in the other words, &#8216;. o. l d&#8217; you would readily guess would be
&#8216;<i>world</i>,&#8217; and that would supply you with an &#8216;R&#8217; for the second word of the second
line, namely, &#8216;r a i n s&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;grains,&#8217; of course. And so
you quickly finish the cipher<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8216;Little drops of water,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Little grains of sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make the mighty ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the beauteous land.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8216;Little acts of kindness,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Little deeds of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make this world an Eden,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like the Heaven above.&#8217;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Though, by the way, the printers have accidentally dropped the final letter in
&#8216;Heaven.&#8217;</p>

<p>You will now understand that simple ciphers can with a little experience be
easily read. Just try your ingenuity on the first one you find in any daily
newspaper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXII02">
<img src="images/illo336.png" alt="triangle" width="200" height="258" />
</div>

<p>Here, by the way, is a kind of cryptogram which is difficult to decipher, and in
which you might write to a friend through the public prints with comparative safety.
The key to it is a rectangular triangle, and you write the word you want
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
transpose from A to B (<i>vide</i> <a href="#FigXXXII02">figure</a> subjoined), the transposed word will be found
at A&mdash;C. Thus, suppose we wanted to write the following sentence, which you
will perceive contains nothing but the truth:&mdash;&#8216;<span class="smcap">The Boy&#8217;s Own Paper</span> is the best
magazine of its kind, and we all dearly love it.&#8217; Well, take your first word, &#8216;The,&#8217;
and arrange it in a triangle, filling it with the letters which follow naturally in the
Alphabet, <span class="nowrap">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="encryption" summary="encryption">

<td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>H</td>
<td>I</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>E</td>
<td>F</td>
<td>G</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>The word &#8216;The&#8217; thus cryptogramised becomes &#8216;T I G.&#8217; Now let us form a
few of the other words in triangles, all in a row to save space<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="noindent">and so on, and we would thus find that our little cipher would read thus:&mdash;&#8216;Tig
Bpav Oxp Pbrhv it tig bfuw mbiddotm,&#8217; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Now there are two things to which I wish to call your attention in this cipher:
first, the primary letter of the transposed word is the same in every case as the
original; and secondly, the letters are different in each word. Just observe that
the &#8216;T&#8217; in the word &#8216;The&#8217; remains a &#8216;T,&#8217;
but in the word &#8216;Best&#8217; it becomes a &#8216;W.&#8217;
The &#8216;I&#8217; in the word &#8216;Is&#8217; remains an &#8216;I,&#8217;
but in the word &#8216;Magazine&#8217; it becomes
an &#8216;O.&#8217; In the latter word the first &#8216;A&#8217; becomes
&#8216;B,&#8217; and the second &#8216;D,&#8217; and &#8216;Z&#8217;
is also &#8216;D.&#8217;</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me just add that I consider cipher-reading one of the best
mental exercises that any boy could indulge in.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII.&mdash;HAMMOCK-MAKING AND NETTING.</h3>

<h4 class="fsize80">I.&mdash;HAMMOCKS AND HAMMOCK-MAKING.</h4>

<p class="noindent">A hammock, as most of our readers are doubtless aware, is a species of swinging
bed in use at sea, and especially in the Royal Navy. Its chief utility lies in the
readiness and ease with which it can be taken down, made up into a comparatively
small bundle, and stowed away during the day, so as to leave the deck clear. A
hammock is not at all difficult of construction, and any boy who is at all handy
with his fingers should be able to make one for himself.</p>

<p>The hammock is made of canvas, which is suspended at each end by a number
of small cords, termed clews, which are made fast to hooks in the beams.</p>

<p>A mattress, with the usual quantity of blankets, a pillow, etc., rests upon the
canvas, which, owing to the manner in which it is hung&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, up to the beams&mdash;assumes
an oval shape, and is really one of the most comfortable things in the
world to sleep in. Its only drawback is the number of opportunities it gives to
mischievous messmates to play off practical jokes upon a youngster who is making
his first trip at sea.</p>

<p>Of course this is discountenanced in the Navy, but it is impossible altogether
to prevent it; and no doubt many a victim to a slippery hitch could bear witness
to the truth of this.</p>

<p>A slippery hitch, we may as well
inform our readers, is a species of
slipknot tied in the lanyard which
connects the clews and the hook in
the beam. It appears all right to a
casual observer, but when the victim
gets into his hammock his weight
begins to tell, and the knot slips
away and precipitates the sleeper on
to the deck.</p>

<p>Then, again, there was the custom, which we hope and believe has gone out of
fashion now, of &#8216;cutting down,&#8217; which was effected by applying a sharp knife to
the lanyard, and letting the sleeper down, generally head foremost.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXIII01a">
<img src="images/illo337.png" alt="hammock" width="500" height="225" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>Now with respect to making a hammock, the first thing necessary is a piece of
strong canvas, about 5 ft 8 in. in length and 3 ft. wide. In the Navy hammocks are
made in two pieces (<a href="#FigXXXIII01a">Fig. 1</a>), which are stitched together down the centre (<span class="smcapall">B</span>). The
sides and ends must be hemmed, and then the eyelet-holes for the clews to be
fastened to must be made (<span class="smcapall">A A</span>). The eyelet-holes are twenty-four in number, at
equal distances along the edge, at each end of the hammock. They are usually made
in the following manner, although it is not absolutely necessary to be so particular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>A number of small rings made of white line (a kind of whipcord) are prepared,
which are called grummets. These are placed in the eyelet-holes, and then sewn
over all the way round with thin twine.</p>

<p>The next thing to make is a pair of clews. These are composed of what are
termed at sea knittles, which are two or three yarns laid up together, by a jack or
by hand, against the twist of the yarn. But good cod-line or anything else
sufficiently stout, will answer the purpose equally well. The following is the proper
way to make clews, although it is now sometimes dispensed with<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Take twelve knittles about 5 ft. in length and double them. Then form an eye
in the middle, which must be <i>served</i> with fine twine. This is done by winding the
twine round and round as tightly as possible for a sufficient distance to form the eye;
then <i>seize</i> or bind the knittles together for about an inch below the eye, as in <a href="#FigXXXIII02a">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 4.</p>
</div>

</div><!--figright-->

</div><!--figc450-->

<p>Now take a piece of twine, about half the size of the knittles, and place it
between the knittles, so that twelve come up and twelve go down (<a href="#FigXXXIII03a">Fig. 3</a>); next
bring both ends of the small twine, which is called <i>filling</i>, back again between the
knittles, only altering them, making the upper ones point down and the lower ones
point up; then leave out the two outside knittles and continue the circuit, leaving
two knittles out each time until you come down to the last two, when knot the
filling together and cut off the ends (<a href="#FigXXXIII04a">Fig. 4</a>). The ends of the knittles are then
passed through the eyelet-holes in the canvas and fastened with two half-hitches.
For the Navy now a great many clews are made without the platting arrangement
we have described, and are left quite plain from the seizing below the eye down to
the eyelet-hole. But the description we have given is of the old-fashioned style,
and to our mind it looks much neater and more ornamental.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXIII05a">
<img src="images/illo338d.jpg" alt="hammock" width="550" height="113" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 5.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>A piece of rope, called a lanyard, must now be spliced with an eye-splice into
the eye of the clew that is to form the foot clew, and the hammock is completed.</p>

<p>In order to sling this it will be necessary to purchase a couple of stout hooks
which will screw into the woodwork. These are easily obtained at any ironmonger&#8217;s,
and may be fastened at the two opposite corners of a room, or in two trees in the
garden at a convenient distance apart.</p>

<p>Then hook the head clew on, and pass the lanyard over the other hook, get the
hammock level, and fasten it with a clove-hitch or two half-hitches.</p>

<p>And now one word of caution with regard to getting into a hammock. Be very
careful the first time or two, and take notice how the hammock recedes, and then
swings towards you. If you jump into it in the same manner as you would into a
bed, the chances are that you will go right over it, and land on the ground the
other side; but with a little care the proper method does not take long to learn.</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">II.&mdash;NETTING, AND HOW TO NET.</h4>

<p>To the reader who is desirous of learning the art of netting, we must give the same
advice that the famous Mrs. Glasse did with reference to cooking a hare, viz.: &#8216;First
obtain your hare.&#8217; That is to say, the first thing is to obtain the netting instruments
and materials.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXIII01b">
<img src="images/illo339.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="260" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.<br />
A, The needle. B, The mesh stick. C, The twine.</p>
</div>

<p>The instruments consist of a needle and a mesh (see <a href="#FigXXXIII01b">Fig. 1</a>). From eight to
ten inches is a good length for the needle, while the mesh stick must vary according
to the size of the net you are
about to make. A mesh stick
will make a mesh twice its own
size. Thus a stick half an inch
square will make a one-inch mesh.</p>

<p>Any youth at all handy with
a knife can manufacture these
articles for himself, and there only
remains to obtain the material.
This must depend upon what is
going to be made, for once the
stitch is learned there is no more
difficulty in making a large seine
than in making an onion net or
a network hammock.</p>

<div class="figc510">

<div class="figleft" id="FigXXXIII02b">

<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

</div><!--figc510-->

<p>The better plan is to go to
the nearest string shop, and pick out what is suitable in size and strength as well as
in <i>price</i>. When the material is purchased&mdash;<i>white line</i>, <i>seine twine</i>, or common twine,
whatever it may be&mdash;if it is not already in a ball, wind it into one. Then find a hook,
or place one just a convenient distance above you as you sit, to which to fasten the
end of the twine. Now fill your needle, pass the twine round the <i>tine</i>, or inside
point, round the heel of the needle, then up round the tine again, until the
needle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
is full. Now fasten the end of the twine to the hook&mdash;a nail, if it be firm, will
answer the same purpose&mdash;and tie a loop in it (<a href="#FigXXXIII02b">Fig. 2</a>). Then lay the mesh stick
underneath the twine, and pass
the needle up through the loop
(<a href="#FigXXXIII03b">Fig. 3</a>). Then pull it tight, so
that the end of the loop rests
against the mesh stick (<a href="#FigXXXIII04b">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<div class="figc620">

<div class="figleft" id="FigXXXIII04b">

<p class="caption">Fig. 6.</p>
</div>

</div><!--figr375-->

</div><!--figc600-->

<p>Now comes the important part,
the formation of the knot. Hold
the mesh stick in your left hand,
with the thumb on the twine, and
with the needle in the right hand.
Now with a quick jerk throw the
<i>bight</i> or loop of the twine over
the stick and left wrist, as shown
in <a href="#FigXXXIII05b">Fig. 5</a>.</p>

<p>Then push the point of the needle up between the first loop made, and the
twine to the left of it, pull the needle through, and bring the knot into shape
(<a href="#FigXXXIII06b">Fig. 6</a>), then tighten by pulling the needle in the direction of the dotted lines, and
the knot is tied.</p>

<p>This simple knot is the foundation of all net-making, and once the
reader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
succeeds in making that, he will very quickly be able to manufacture anything he
may require in that branch of work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXIII07b">
<img src="images/illo341a.jpg" alt="netting" width="600" height="47" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.</p>
</div>

<p>Now slip out the mesh stick and take the same stitch through the loop you have
just made, and so continue on, passing the needle every time through the last loop
made until you have made enough. You can generally guess the number of meshes
you will require by the size of the mesh stick. By the time you have made as many
as you think will be requisite, your work ought to look something like <a href="#FigXXXIII07b">Fig. 7</a>.</p>

<p>Next unfasten the end from the hook or nail, and untie the first loop made,
because it is not the same size as the subsequent ones. Now pass a piece of cord
through the upper row of meshes, tie the ends of the cord together, and hang it
again over the hook.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXIII08b">
<img src="images/illo341b.jpg" alt="netting" width="550" height="216" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 8.</p>
</div>

<p>Next go on with the work as before, only do not slip the loop off the stick as at
first. Knot through <span class="smcapall">E</span>, <a href="#FigXXXIII08b">Fig. 8</a>,
then through <span class="smcapall">D</span>, then <span class="smcapall">C</span>, and so on, until you have
travelled along the whole width.</p>

<p>Then turn the work over and travel back again in the same manner. It is better
to make ten or a dozen meshes before slipping the stick out.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXIII09b">
<img src="images/illo341c.jpg" alt="netting" width="300" height="299" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 9.</p>
</div>

<p>Presuming that the twine breaks, or you wish to join another ball, the way to do
it is with a &#8216;becket-hitch,&#8217; commonly called a &#8216;weaver&#8217;s knot.&#8217; Form a bight
with one part, pass the other part up through the loop, then over, under and back
through its own loop (<a href="#FigXXXIII09b">Fig. 9</a>).</p>

<p>With regard to making a network hammock, proceed as we have described, and
to make a full-sized hammock you would require between fifty and sixty two-inch
meshes each way.</p>

<p>Then make the clews, as described in the <a href="#Page_337">article</a> on canvas hammocks, and
fasten them in the usual manner to each end of the hammock, tying the ends as
regularly as you can.</p>

<p>Netting is a very pleasant as well as useful occupation, and is more suitable for
boys than girls, owing to the strain of pulling the knots tight. The pleasure of
being able to make nets for fishing, nets for the garden, to keep the birds off the
trees, nets to hang vegetables or fruit in, and lastly, but not least, a net hammock,
ought to amply repay any trouble or inconvenience caused by learning.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV.&mdash;A PERPETUAL CALENDAR.<br />
<span class="smcap">By Herr H. F. L. Meyer.</span></h3>

<h4 class="fsize80">EXPLANATIONS.</h4>

<p class="noindent">Various perpetual calendars have been published, but some of them are very
elaborate, and others incorrect; therefore, by the editor&#8217;s invitation, I now present
one in a most handy form. <a href="#CalTab">Table 1</a> shows the centuries, with the key numbers;
<a href="#CalTab">Table 2</a>, the last two figures of the year, and the seven key numbers below;
<a href="#CalTab">Table 3</a>, the months; and <a href="#CalTab">Table 4</a>, the days. The key numbers are printed thick,
the leap years in italics. January and February have two keys each, 3 and 6 for
common years, 2 and 5 for leap years. The eleven days from September 3rd to
13th, 1752, were omitted. Every year which divides by 4 without a remainder is
a leap year, except the centenaries, which are printed upright.</p>

<p>This 4 is the key for <a href="#CalTab">Table 4</a>, where, on the right-hand side of this key, under
the 21 st day, we find Wednesday.</p>

<p>If the three keys together make more than 6, seven is subtracted; and if more
than 13, fourteen is deducted, and the remainder is the key to <a href="#CalTab">Table 4</a>.</p>

<p>Thus we find June 6th, 1839, through 0 + 6 + 0 = 6, = Thursday.</p>

<p>August 9th, 1732, through 6 + 5 + 5 = 16, - 14 = 2 = Wednesday.</p>

<p>Columbus sailed from Palos on Friday, August 3rd, 1492, and discovered
America on the 12th of October, 1492, which was also a Friday.</p>

<p class="blankbefore">Example No. 2.&mdash;In what years will Christmas Day fall on a Sunday? <a href="#CalTab">Table 4</a>
shows, below the 25th, the Sunday on the side of key 4; subtract the key of
December, which is 1, there remains, for the present century, the key 3 of <a href="#CalTab">Table 2</a>,
showing the years 1887, 1892, 1898 and as this 4 for the next century will come
from 5 + <i>x</i> + 1 minus 7, it follows that <i>x</i> means the key 5 in <a href="#CalTab">Table 2</a>, which contains
the years 1904, 1910, 1921, and the other years in that column.</p>

<p>We found the 6th of June, 1839, to be a Thursday, and see from the last
column of <a href="#CalTab">Table 2</a> that it was again on a Thursday in 1844, 1850, 1861, etc.</p>

<p>Any one born on the 29th February, 1864, will have his birthday again on the
same day of the week, a Monday, in 1892, that is, after an interval of 28 years, as
is seen in the middle column of <a href="#CalTab">Table 2</a>; and after that he will have it again on a
Monday in 1904, 1932, etc.</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">HISTORICAL NOTES.</h4>

<p>Romulus, the founder of Rome, established a year consisting of ten months,
named Martius, Aprilis, Maius, Junius, Quintilis, Sextilis, September, October,
November, and December; but in the succeeding reign, that of Numa, two months
were added, called Januarius and Februarius.</p>

<p>Julius C&aelig;sar, aided by Sosigenes, an Alexandrian astronomer, instituted the
Julian Calendar, which has come down to our own epoch. It was then decided to
give an additional day to every fourth year. The date of the reform was 45 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>,
which was the Roman year 708, dating from the foundation of Rome. The Julian
year began on the 1st of January, 708 <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span>, and ended on the 31st of December,
709 <span class="smcap">A.U.C.</span> In the first 48 years of the reform there prevailed some confusion about
the bissextile or leap years, because during the first 36 years every third year was
reckoned a leap year (12 intercalations had taken place instead of 9); but, in order
to rectify the error, the next 12 years (<i>i.e.</i> 9 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>
to 3 <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> inclusive), elapsed
without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
an intercalary day, by decree of C&aelig;sar Augustus, who also changed the names of
Quintilis and Sextilis into Julius and Augustus, in honour of his uncle and himself.
Thus the Roman years, 757, 761, 765, 769, etc., which were the years <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> 4, 8, 12,
16, etc., were counted as leap years, and about all succeeding dates there is no
doubt.</p>

<p>&#8216;It was probably,&#8217; writes Mr. Bond, of the Record Office, in his valuable work,
&#8216;the original intention of C&aelig;sar to commence the new year with the shortest day,
the winter solstice at Rome, in the year 46 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> (common era), occurring on the
24th December of the Julian calendar. His motive for delaying the commencement
for seven days longer, instead of taking the following day, was no doubt the
desire to gratify the superstition of the Romans, by causing the commencement of
the first year of the reformed calendar to fall on the day of the new moon, for it is
found that the mean new moon occurred at Rome on the 1st of January, 45 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>
(common era), at 6 h. 16 m. p.m.&#8217;</p>

<p>The Christian era was introduced in Italy, in the 6th century, by Dionysius the
Little, a Roman abbot, and began to be used in Gaul in the 8th, though it was not
generally followed in that country till a century later. From extant charters it is
known to have been in use in England before the close of the 8th century. &#8216;At
first, in <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> 533,&#8217; says Mr. Bond, &#8216;the era began with the 25th of March, but was
subsequently reckoned from Christmas Day, the 25th of December, and in the
13th century, in some countries, was reckoned from the 1st of January according
to the Julian era.&#8217;</p>

<p>The exact length of the mean solar or civil year is</p>

<p class="center blankbefore">365 d. 5 h. 48 m. 46 s.,</p>

<p class="noindent blankbefore">therefore the Julian year, being 365 days and 6 hours, departs from the course of
the seasons at the rate of 11 m. 14 s., and consequently Aloysius Lilius, from
Calabria, a physician and mathematician of Verona, projected a plan for amending
the calendar, which induced Pope Gregory XIII. to introduce the plan on the 5th
October, 1582, according to the former style, which day was decreed to be called
the 15th October. These 10 days rectified the error of the past, in accordance
with the day of the equinox, the 21st March. The error of the future, which was
that an additional day every fourth year was too much, but that 129 years must
elapse before the redundance would cause the equinox to be one day behind its
time, was rectified thus: Adding 129 years to the year 1582 there results the year
1711, and it was decreed that the year 1700, which would, by the Julian Calendar,
be a leap year, should be a common year, but, as stated below, it was still kept as
a leap year in England, and appears as such in <a href="#CalTab">Table 1</a>. In like manner 1800 was
made a common year, and as in 1969 the 21st March would be a day behind the
vernal equinox, it will be set right by making 1900 a common year. Another
period of 129 years would extend to 2098, which will be remedied by making 2100
a common instead of a leap year.</p>

<p>Thus the equinox will be kept right by making three successive secular years
common years; and the secular leap years will be those of which the first two
figures are divisible by 4 without a remainder, as 2000, 2400, 2800, etc.</p>

<p>The Papal decree of October, 1582, was adopted in France in December, 1582,
in Poland in 1586, in the Catholic States of Germany in 1583, in the Protestant
German States, through Weigel&#8217;s Calendar, in 1700, in Denmark and Switzerland soon
after the adoption in Germany, in England in September, 1752, whereas Russia
still adheres to the Julian Calendar. Thus the Russian legal equinoxes are now
twelve days in advance of the real equinoxes.</p>

<p>In England the years used to begin upon the 25th March, but it was declared
that 1752 should end on the 31st December, and 1753 begin on the day formerly
called the 1st January, 1752. At that time the people in England used to write
the new style under the old, thus<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blankbefore">The death of Charles I. took place on Tuesday, January 30, 1648, as written at
that time, but it is now written January 30, 1649, and often expressed by historians
thus:&mdash;January 30, 1648-9.</p>

<p>In Scotland, the day after 31st December, 1599, was called 1st January, 1600.</p>

<p>The 4th August, 1581, was a Friday in all parts of Europe, but from 1582 to
1752 there was a variance in various parts, as there still is at present, between the
east and the west of Europe. The variance was in the days of the month; the days
of the week never changed. The 2nd September, 1752, was a Wednesday in
England and in Russia, but a Saturday in the other States of Europe. Thus we
find the 20th December, 1647, for England and Russia, through 0 + 2 + 1 = 3 = Monday,
but for Italy, France, Spain, etc., through 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 - 7 = 0 = Friday.
The 14th September, 1752, was a Monday in Russia, but a Thursday
in England and the other European States. The 21st June, 1887, was a Tuesday
in England, but in Russia it was twelve days later, that is, a Sunday, namely,
the Sunday on which we had the 3rd of July. The Russians had the 9th June,
1887, on a Tuesday, that is the day on which we had the 21st June; and in
writing to us they express that day thus:&mdash;June <span class="datechange"><span class="olddate">9</span>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXV.&mdash;HOW TO MAKE A SUNDIAL.<br />
<span class="smcap">By F. Chasemore.</span></h3>

<h4 class="fsize80">I.&mdash;THE HORIZONTAL DIAL.</h4>

<p class="noindent">A very useful and instructive pastime for boys will be found in the construction of a
sundial, full directions for making which I give in this chapter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXV01a">
<img src="images/illo347.png" alt="sundial" width="500" height="500" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="largeillo"><a href="images/illo347lg.png">Fig. 1 enlarged</a> (112 kB)</p>

<p>The first thing to be done is to make what is called the dialing scale (<a href="#FigXXXV01a">Fig. 1</a>).
It is constructed as follows: With a pair of compasses describe the circle <span class="smcapall">A B C D</span>
with any radius, say four inches. Draw the two diameters <span class="smcapall">A C</span>
and <span class="smcapall">B D</span>, cutting each
other at right angles in the point 0. Join <span class="smcapall">D C</span>
for the scale of chords and <span class="smcapall">B C</span> for
the scale of latitudes. Through the point <span class="smcapall">B</span> draw the straight line 12&mdash;6 parallel
and equal to the line <span class="smcapall">A C</span>, and let the
point <span class="smcapall">B</span> bisect it. Join the points 0&mdash;12 and
0&mdash;6, cutting the circle in the points <span class="smcapall">E</span>
 and <span class="smcapall">F</span>. Now divide the arcs <span class="smcapall">E B</span> and <span class="smcapall">B F</span>
each into three equal parts, and from the point 0 draw straight lines
through these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
points of division to the line 12&mdash;6, marking the points of intersection 12, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6. This line is called the line of hours.</p>

<p>To make the scale of chords, divide the arc <span class="smcapall">D C</span> into nine equal parts, and then
with the compasses, with one leg placed on the point <span class="smcapall">C</span>, protract each division on
the line <span class="smcapall">C D</span>. Mark the points on this line
from <span class="smcapall">C</span> 10, 20, 30, etc.; the point <span class="smcapall">D</span> will
mark 90 degrees.</p>

<p>To make the scale of latitudes, draw lines from the points of division in the arc
<span class="smcapall">D C</span> parallel to the line <span class="smcap">D 0</span>, and cutting the line <span class="smcap">0 C</span> in points, counting from 0, 10,
20, 30, 40, etc. Now draw straight lines from <span class="smcapall">D</span> through these points, cutting the
arc <span class="smcapall">B C</span> in the points 10, 20, 30, etc., and with your compasses, with one leg on <span class="smcapall">B</span>,
protract these distances on to the line <span class="smcapall">B C</span>, which will be the scale of latitudes. Now
our dialing scale is finished.</p>

<p>To make the dial, which will be a horizontal one, you must get a piece of zinc
plate about one foot square. On this mark all round it, and one inch from the
edges, lines making a smaller square of ten inches
a side. Plate <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch thick.</p>

<p>Bisect one line of this square, and draw a line
from this point to a point bisecting the opposite side.
Now draw two other lines, one on each side of, and
one-sixteenth of an inch from, this line, and parallel
to it. These lines will then be one-eighth of an
inch apart. They are made this distance apart as
the style, or gnomon, will be that thickness, and
has to stand between them. Now divide the other
sides into five equal parts, and join the two second
points of division, counting from the bottom. This
line, which is called the six-o&#8217;clock line, will cut
the two parallel lines in the points <span class="smcapall">A C</span> (<a href="#FigXXXV02a">Fig. 2</a>).
Mark the other or top ends of these lines <span class="smcapall">B</span> and <span class="smcapall">D</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXV02a">
<img src="images/illo348.png" alt="sundial" width="350" height="338" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>

<p>Now with your compasses take from the scale of latitudes the latitude of the
place where you wish to erect your dial. Suppose you are in London, put one leg
of the compasses on the point <span class="smcapall">B</span>, and the other leg on the point in the scale of latitudes
marking 51<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> degrees, which is the latitude of London. Now mark this distance off
on the six-o&#8217;clock line from <span class="smcapall">C</span> to
<span class="smcapall">E</span> and from <span class="smcapall">A</span> to
<span class="smcapall">F</span> (<a href="#FigXXXV02a">Fig. 2</a>). Now take the length
of the line of hours from 12&mdash;6 in the compasses, and, putting one leg on the
point <span class="smcapall">E</span>, intersect the line
<span class="smcapall">C D</span> in the point <span class="smcapall">G</span>. Do the same on the other side,
putting one leg on point <span class="smcapall">F</span>, and
intersecting the line <span class="smcapall">A B</span> in the point <span class="smcapall">H</span>. Draw the
lines <span class="smcapall">G E</span> and <span class="smcapall">H E</span> (<a href="#FigXXXV02a">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>These lines are the same length as in the line of hours; mark them as that line is
marked, using your compasses to get the distances, marking the line from
<span class="smcapall">G</span> to <span class="smcapall">E</span>
and from <span class="smcapall">H</span> to <span class="smcapall">E</span>;
now from the point <span class="smcapall">C</span> draw lines through the divisions on <span class="smcapall">G E</span> to
the lines of the inner square; do the same from point
<span class="smcapall">A</span> through the line <span class="smcapall">H F</span>. The
fourth and fifth lines on the right side must be continued back through the point <span class="smcapall">C</span>
to opposite side of square, and the seventh and eighth on the left be continued back
through <span class="smcapall">A</span> to right side. Now mark the hours. The double line is the twelve-o&#8217;clock
line, and must be marked twelve. The line to the right is the
one-o&#8217;clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
line, the next two, and so on to eight on the right side. On the left the line next
the twelve-o&#8217;clock line is eleven, the next ten, and so on back to four. All the
lines can be marked on the zinc with a pointed bradawl.</p>

<p>The dial plate is now finished.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXV03a">
<img src="images/illo349.png" alt="sundial" width="250" height="281" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>The next step is to make the gnomon. For this get a piece of the same zinc
plate about six inches by eight. Along one of the shorter sides, about a quarter of
an inch from the edge, draw a line <span class="smcapall">A B</span>,
making it equal in length to <span class="smcapall">C</span>&mdash;60 on the
scale of chords. With one leg of the compasses on the point <span class="smcapall">A</span>, and the other
opened out to <span class="smcapall">B</span>, draw the arc
<span class="smcapall">B C</span> as in <a href="#FigXXXV03a">Fig. 3</a>. Now from the same scale of
chords take the length of the latitude of the place, and mark it along the arc <span class="smcapall">B C</span>
from <span class="smcapall">B</span>, join <span class="smcapall">A C</span>,
from <span class="smcapall">C</span> draw a line at right angles to
<span class="smcapall">A B</span>, cutting it in the point <span class="smcapall">D</span>
(<a href="#FigXXXV03a">Fig. 3</a>). The triangle <span class="smcapall">A D C</span>
will be the gnomon, with the line <span class="smcapall">A D</span> for its base.
Cut this triangle out carefully, making the edges quite square. Now you must get
a tinman to solder this in its place on the dial-plate,
the point <span class="smcapall">A</span> of the gnomon to be at the points <span class="smcapall">A C</span>
on the plate, and the line <span class="smcapall">A D</span> along the two lines
<span class="smcapall">A H</span> and <span class="smcapall">C G</span>. You must be very careful that the
gnomon stands at right angles to the dial-plate.</p>

<p>The dial must be fixed in a sunny spot, if
possible in the middle of a large lawn. The best
way to do this is to fasten the dial-plate on a square
board, which is fastened to a post driven into the
ground. The post can be ornamented with rustic
work. The dial must be quite level, and the
gnomon pointing due north.</p>

<p>The line <span class="smcapall">A C</span> of the gnomon being made at the
angle from the base equal to the latitude of the
place will be parallel to the axis of the earth, and
will show the hours correctly both on long and
short days, as the sun&#8217;s course is at right angles
to it. The dial can be made to show quarters or five minutes if you so divide the
line of hours on the dial scale. The dial, if placed in an open, sunny spot, will
show the hours from sunrise to sunset.</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">II.&mdash;THE EQUATORIAL DIAL.</h4>

<p>The horizontal sundial would be suitable for all places north and south of the
equator. But in southern latitudes the style must point due south instead of north,
and the numbering must be done from right to left instead of from left to right.
The method, however, already described would not do for any place situated <i>exactly</i>
on the equator. The reason for this is&mdash;the style, or gnomon, being parallel to the
axis of the earth, it would be horizontal at the equator, and perpendicular at the
poles, and the shadow would be parallel to the style at the equator and perpendicular
to it at the poles. The style must be regulated in height by the size of
the dial-plate, and the length of the line of hours, in the scale, must be regulated
by the height of the upper edge of the style from the dial-plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXV01b">
<img src="images/illo350a.png" alt="sundial" width="500" height="314" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1</p>
</div>

<p>I will now explain the construction of the equatorial dial. The dial-plate is to
be cut about eighteen inches long by twelve inches wide. The inner lines are to be
drawn all round, about one inch from the edges, as in the dial already described.
Divide the dial-plate into two equal
parts by a line drawn from points bisecting
the long sides, as in <a href="#FigXXXV01b">Fig. 1</a> in
the accompanying illustrations. This
line is the twelve-o&#8217;clock line. The
two lines <span class="smcapall">A B</span> and <span class="smcapall">C D</span> are to be drawn
parallel to this line, one on each side
of and a sixteenth of an inch from it.
Before the hour lines can be drawn
the style must be made. This must
be rectangular in shape, with the
long sides equal in length to the
twelve-o&#8217;clock lines between the inner
lines of the plate, and must not, for
this size of dial-plate, be more than two inches wide or high. The dialing scale
must now be made. It consists only of the line of hours. Draw the two lines
<span class="smcapall">O A</span> and <span class="smcapall">O B</span> at right angles to each other, and make each equal in length
to the height of the gnomon, or style&mdash;viz., two inches. Draw <span class="smcapall">B C</span> parallel to
<span class="smcapall">O A</span>, and make it about ten or twelve inches long.
Describe the arc <span class="smcapall">A B</span>, with <span class="smcapall">O</span>
for the centre, and <span class="smcapall">O A</span> and
<span class="smcapall">O B</span> for radii, as in <a href="#FigXXXV02b">Fig. 2</a>. Divide this arc into six
equal parts, and draw lines from the point <span class="smcapall">O</span> through the points of division to cut
the line <span class="smcapall">B C</span> in the points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The six-o&#8217;clock point will not be required.
This is the line of
hours. With your
compasses mark on
the side lines of the
dial-plate, from the
points <span class="smcapall">A B</span> and <span class="smcapall">C D</span>,
the divisions of the
line of hours. Join
the corresponding points on each side of the twelve-o&#8217;clock line by lines drawn
parallel to it. These lines will represent the hours, and are numbered 1 to 5 to the
right and 11 to 7 to the left. <a href="#FigXXXV03b">Fig. 3</a> shows this dial.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXV02b">

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXV03b">
<img src="images/illo350c.jpg" alt="sundial" width="600" height="131" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3</p>
</div>

<p>This dial does not show the time before seven o&#8217;clock in the morning or after
five o&#8217;clock in the evening. The reason of this is, the days and nights at
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
equator being equal&mdash;viz., twelve hours each&mdash;the sun rises and sets at six o&#8217;clock.
At six o&#8217;clock, the sun being exactly on the horizon, any object placed in the middle
of a perfectly horizontal plane would cast an indefinite or unlimited shadow, as the
shadow of the upper part would be parallel to the plane, and of course could not
meet it. The dial can be made to show any time after six in the morning or before
six in the evening by lengthening the dial-plate. <a href="#FigXXXV04b">Fig. 4</a> will show how inconvenient
it would be to have a plate to show the time before seven or after five
o&#8217;clock. In <a href="#FigXXXV04b">Fig. 4</a> the hour from five to six is divided into quarters, and shows
that for 5.30 the plate must be about double, and for 5.45 about four times, the
length required to show the time between seven and five o&#8217;clock. So that a plate
about six feet long would be required for a dial having a style two inches high.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXV04b">
<img src="images/illo351a.png" alt="sundial" width="600" height="162" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4</p>
</div>

<p>The style is to be soldered to the dial-plate between the two lines
<span class="smcapall">A B</span> and <span class="smcapall">C D</span>,
and must be equal in thickness to the distance between them. The dial must be
set up in a horizontal position with the gnomon directed due north and south.</p>

<p>Both these dials are horizontal. I will now
explain the construction of vertical dials, or dials
that are fixed in an upright position against a
wall or house. The dialing scale, as already
described, will be required for the construction
of a vertical dial to be fixed on a wall facing
the south.</p>

<p>Cut the zinc plate twelve inches square,
and mark it with the inner square, the twelve-o&#8217;clock
lines, and the six-o&#8217;clock line, as in the
horizontal dial. From the line of latitudes, in
the scale, take the length equal to the difference
between 90 deg. and the latitude of the place
(that is, not as in the horizontal dial, the latitude,
but the complement of it).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXV05b">
<img src="images/illo351b.png" alt="sundial" width="350" height="340" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 5</p>
</div>

<p>Taking London as the place, take from the
scale 38<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> deg., which is the difference between
90 and 51<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> deg. This distance must be marked off on the six-o&#8217;clock line from the
points <span class="smcapall">A</span> and <span class="smcapall">C</span>.
The rest of the construction is the same as for the horizontal dial,
with the exception that the hours are limited to fourteen, viz. from five to
seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
o&#8217;clock, and are numbered backwards, or from left to right as in <a href="#FigXXXV05b">Fig. 5</a>. The style
is made as for the horizontal dial, but the angle <span class="smcapall">C A B</span>
is to equal 38<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> deg. in the
case of London, or the complement of the latitude. The base <span class="smcapall">A D</span> is to equal the
length of the twelve-o&#8217;clock lines, measuring from the six-o&#8217;clock line to the inside
line at the lower edge, or the lines <span class="smcapall">A B</span> and
<span class="smcapall">C D</span>. In fixing this dial care must
be taken to let it face due south.</p>

<p>The east and west vertical dials are made something like the equatorial
horizontal dial, with a rectangular style. The same
scale is required for making the line of hours, the
lines of which are regulated in length by the height of
the style. Make the plate about eighteen inches long
and twelve inches wide, and draw the double lines
which in these dials represent the six-o&#8217;clock line,
as in Figs. 7 and 8. These double lines are drawn,
making an angle with the lower edge of dial-plate
equal to the latitude of the place. The style is cut
rectangular, with the long sides equal to the double
six o&#8217;clock lines, and the short sides two inches long. Draw the scale making
<span class="smcapall">O A</span> and <span class="smcapall">O B</span> two inches long, and mark the hour line. Before the points on
the hour line can be marked in on the dial-plate, a plan (<a href="#FigXXXV09b">Fig. 9</a>) must be made.
Draw on a large piece of paper a plan of either dial-plate, and mark in the
double lines. Through these draw the line <span class="smcapall">A B</span> perpendicular to them as in
<a href="#FigXXXV09b">Fig. 9</a>. On this line, on each side of the double lines, mark the points on the
hour line, and through these points draw lines parallel to the double lines, and
letting them cut the sides of the plan of the dial-plate. The points where the lines
cut it can be transferred to the dial-plate with a pair of compasses, and the hour
lines drawn in parallel to the six-o&#8217;clock line. The style must be fixed in its place,
and will be parallel to the axis of the earth when the dial is fixed up with the long
sides quite horizontal. The east dial is marked as in <a href="#FigXXXV07b">Fig. 7</a>, and the west as in
<a href="#FigXXXV08b">Fig. 8</a>, if for the northern hemisphere. For the southern, the west dial would take
the place of the east, and the east, the place of the west with the numbering reversed.</p>

<p>There are several other kinds of sundials, which may be used for any degree of
latitude, a few of which I will describe.</p>

<p>The first of these is the globular (<a href="#FigXXXV10b">Fig. 10</a>). This is a white globe (any size),
supported on an axis which is fixed in a position parallel to the axis of the
earth (or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
making an angle with the horizon equal to the latitude of the place, and pointing
due north or south), in which position the globe is acted on by the sun exactly as
the earth is. The globe is divided into twenty-four equal parts by lines running
from pole to pole, and has an
equator drawn around it, on
which the hours are marked
from 1 to 12 twice over. The
axis is fixed in a stand so that
one of the six-o&#8217;clock lines is
in the zenith. The time is
indicated by the edge of the
shaded part (caused by the
sun illuminating one-half of
the globe, leaving the other
in shade) passing over the hour lines. An ordinary globe answers very well for
this dial, if it is rectified for the latitude, and placed so that the brass meridian is
directed north and south.</p>

</div><!--figc460-->

<p><a href="#FigXXXV11b">Fig. 11</a> is another pattern; it is basin-shaped, and is made of a hollow hemisphere
of metal, whitened inside, and has the inside divided into twelve equal parts by lines
running from pole to pole, which are numbered on the equator from 6 to 6. A wire
is stretched from pole to serve as the style, which
casts a shadow on the line corresponding to the
hour. The position of this dial is the same, as
regards the axis of the earth, as <a href="#FigXXXV10b">Fig. 10</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXV12b">
<img src="images/illo353d.jpg" alt="sundial" width="350" height="231" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 12</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#FigXXXV12b">Fig. 12</a> represents what I call the trough-shaped
dial. It is made of metal-plate bent into the shape
of a half-tube; the ends are closed with semicircular
metal plates. The interior is divided into twelve
equal parts by lines running parallel to the edges,
and are numbered from 6 to 6. A wire is
stretched from the centres of the semicircular end plates to serve for the style.</p>

<p>This dial must be fixed, with regard to the position and direction of the
style, as the other dials are. This is the one constant condition of all dials, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
the edge of the style that is to cast the shadow must be parallel to the axis of
the earth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXV13b">
<img src="images/illo354.jpg" alt="sundial" width="250" height="281" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 13</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#FigXXXV13b">Fig. 13</a> is a very simple dial, and is the last I shall
describe. It consists of a circular dial-plate divided into
twenty-four equal parts, numbered from 1 to 12 twice over.
The style is a perpendicular wire fixed in the centre of
the plate. The plate is hinged to a stand, so that one of
the twelve-o&#8217;clock lines runs directly from the top to the
bottom.</p>

<p>From the construction of the <a href="#FigXXXV10b">dials 10</a>,
<a href="#FigXXXV11b">11</a>, <a href="#FigXXXV12b">12</a>, <a href="#FigXXXV13b">13</a>,
they can be used in any latitude, as well as on the equator,
but of course the numbering would have to be reversed
for the southern hemisphere. They all have an arrangement by which the style can
be fixed at the required angle to suit the latitude of the place.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVI.&mdash;THE CAMERA OBSCURA: HOW TO MAKE AND
USE IT.<br />
<span class="smcap">By Gordon Stables, C.M., M.D., R.N.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">Did you never, reader, have a peep in beneath the black cloth where the artist
hides his head while he is focusing a sitter for his photograph? I&#8217;m sure that many
of you have. And what did you see? Why, a pretty little picture in colours of
your friend sitting in the chair, laughing like a tramp at a twopenny roll, only upside
down. And you have said to yourselves, What a pity it won&#8217;t come out in bright
colours like that, and why in all the world should it be upside down?</p>

<p>Now I will answer this question before going any further, because it has a
bearing on the subject before us&mdash;the making of a handy and cheap camera
obscura, which cannot fail to be a source of amusement and pleasure, especially
when the sun shines.</p>

<p>The reason why the object on the photographer&#8217;s ground-glass plate is seen
upside down is easily explained. Light, as
I need hardly remind older boys, proceeds
in straight lines from any illuminated object.
It is thus thrown upon the photographer&#8217;s
plate. A glance at the accompanying diagram
(<a href="#FigXXXVI01">Fig. 1</a>) will suffice to show what I
mean.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXVI01">
<img src="images/illo355.png" alt="camera obscura" width="450" height="334" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>Let <span class="smcapall">A B</span> be the object&mdash;say, an arrow&mdash;under
consideration, and <span class="smcapall">C D</span> a side view of
the ground-glass plate on which the picture
is seen. Passing, therefore, in straight lines,
the light and colour from the point <span class="smcapall">A</span> will fall
at <i>a</i>, will they not? and those from <span class="smcapall">B</span> at <i>b</i>,
and so on from every portion of the arrow,
so that the representation therefore on the object-glass will be upside down, or
reversed. <span class="smcapall">Q.E.D.</span></p>

<p>Now about the camera. No one can be said to have invented it, for it is
constituted upon the firm and immutable laws of Nature. Roger Bacon is credited
with having known this principle. Very likely he did, but he put it to no practical
use, though over four hundred years after his time Giovanni Baptiste Porta did.
But who knows that the ancients hundreds of years before the Flood were unacquainted
with it? Here, for example, is a story a little bird told me one beautiful
summer&#8217;s day while reclining on the greensward in my woodland study: I had
been reading under the shade of my great oak-tree. The sun was very bright, and
patches of its light penetrated even through the dark-green branches and fell
on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
my face. Probably it was that which set me a-thinking about the laws of optics and
the camera obscura and camera lucida. Suddenly close up above me a bird alighted&mdash;it
was early in the season&mdash;and began pouring out the most charming notes.</p>

<p>&#8216;Many people,&#8217; I said to myself, &#8216;would take that bird to be the nightingale,
but I know it is only a black-cap.&#8217;</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of my mouth when a saucy little head with a bright
bead of an eye peeped round the corner of a twig at me.</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Only</i> a black-cap!&#8217; said the owner of the head and the eye. &#8216;I&#8217;d have you
know, sir, that we black-caps, as you call us, are of a far older family than the
nightingales, and that <i>they</i> first learned their wild notes from us, and not <i>we</i> from
them!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You know a deal, I dare say,&#8217; I replied. &#8216;Can you explain this, then?
There is a streak of light creeping in from a point among the boughs up there, and
falling on my foolscap, and whenever a pigeon, or hawk, or rook flies past away
overhead, his image appears on the paper and crosses it, only in a contrary
direction.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Foolscap, indeed!&#8217; replied the bird, &#8216;it is yourself that should be wearing one.
The image on your paper is caused by the reflection of the luminous rays from the
flying bird. Now,&#8217; continued the black-cap, &#8216;I&#8217;ll tell you about the camera.</p>

<p>&#8216;You know the ancient Egyptians understood everything!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;So they supposed,&#8217; I grunted, &#8216;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t interrupt, please. The dungeons of that mysterious land were once
upon a time small and dark and dismal in the extreme, and for a very little fault
indeed people were thrown therein, perhaps never to leave them alive.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, it came to pass that a certain poor man had offended the king, and all
his worldly goods were confiscated and he himself was thrown into a cell in a rock.
It was not a large one, and its walls were smoothly cemented with a mixture of lime
and sand, and some other ingredients known only to the ancient Egyptians. The
cell was situated in the side of a hill, with a door at one side which was opened
only once a week, to thrust in a pitcher of water and a bundle of cassava root, on
which the poor man lived, and to have the cell cleaned out. The only aperture for
light and air was a little round hole at the front of the room, too small for even a
bird to get through, though bees and moths often entered and kept the prisoner
company. But, lo! every day and all day, especially when the sun shone, the rays
of light through that aperture brought with them a picture which they painted on
the opposite wall. This picture was upside down, but that was but a small
drawback, and everything that happened out of doors or in the city beneath was
painted on the wall in a marvellous manner. But when the cell door was opened
the picture faded away, so the gaoler never saw it.</p>

<p>&#8216;One day the prisoner addressed the gaoler as follows: &#8220;Speak unto the king
for me, O my son, and tell him, if all my trespasses are forgiven me, and I am taken
up out of this loathsome den, I will build for him in his palace a dark room in
which he can sit and see all that is going on in the city beneath spread out before
him like a great moving picture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8216;And the gaoler went and spoke to the king in the prisoner&#8217;s behalf, and the
poor man was brought before the king and set to work in a room of the
palace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
tower. With the aid of workmen he turned the room into a camera obscura, by
means of well-placed steel mirrors casting the picture down upon a white concave
table.</p>

<p>&#8216;When the king saw it he was greatly astounded and delighted, and ever after
that there was no guest about the palace so greatly honoured as the poor man he
had but lately thrown into a dungeon.&#8217;</p>

<p>I began to rub my eyes after this, and I am hardly sure yet whether the black-cap
had really been speaking, or whether I had dropped asleep and been dreaming.</p>

<p>However, this prisoner did nothing more than you could do. I slept, when a
boy, in a little turret chamber, which I easily converted into a camera, a description
of which I had read in an old book on &#8216;The Arts and Sciences.&#8217; I had a white
screen placed at the proper focus, and a tiny round hole in the shutter, that was all.
It was a very primitive arrangement, but pleased me then.</p>

<p>And I believe that most of my readers who are over twelve can make a handy
portable camera from the hints I shall now give.</p>

<p>Before you read any further, then, get an empty matchbox, and put it on the
table, bottom upwards. Now draw out the drawer of it about half-way. That
matchbox is your rough model for the
portable camera. Simple, is it not?</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXVI02">
<img src="images/illo357.png" alt="camera obscura" width="450" height="249" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>

<p>The sketch I here append, however
(<a href="#FigXXXVI02">Fig. 2</a>), is not that of a matchbox, but of
your portable camera itself, minus its dark
shade. The size of this portable camera
will depend upon, and be in the ratio of,
your own ambition; the perfection of its
make will depend upon your own ingenuity.</p>

<p>1. Well, then, you are to make or get
made a small box of either very thin wood
or very strong pasteboard, covered with thin cloth and painted some dark colour.
Size, say, six inches high, six inches wide, and one foot long. This box is open
only in front, and therein fits or slips the focusing drawer with its lens.</p>

<p>2. This drawer is also of the same material, and is open at the end that fits into
the box, that is the end opposite the lens, and should work easily in or out, and
admit no light except through the lens, the magnifying power of which need not be
very great.</p>

<p>3. The whole interior of box and drawer is to be stained of a dull black colour.</p>

<p>4. Into the top of the box is let a piece of ground glass, occupying the whole
breadth nearly of the top, and two-thirds of its length.</p>

<p>5. Into the box is fitted or let a mirror, which faces the drawer and lies at an
angle of forty-five degrees.</p>

<p>Now turn your eyes to <a href="#FigXXXVI02">Fig. 2</a>, and I will try to explain it. The dimensions of
the box are marked in plain figures, as the drapers say. The length of the drawer
is about five inches or less. This drawer is represented in the figure as pulled
about half-way out. When shut up it will reach the letters <span class="smcapall">C A</span>. The lens is about
an inch in diameter, and may be bought cheap at any optician&#8217;s, or even fitted for
you there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>The piece of ground glass on the top occupies the position marked out by the
letters <span class="smcapall">F</span>, <span class="smcapall">E</span>,
<span class="smcapall">B</span>, <span class="smcapall">G</span>.</p>

<p>The mirror inside occupies the position indicated by the dotted line <span class="smcapall">A B</span>.</p>

<p>But your camera is not complete yet. You have your dark shade to slip on
and fasten. This shade (<i>vide</i> <a href="#FigXXXVI03">Fig. 3</a>) is a lid, open at both ends, that goes right
over two-thirds of the whole box when closed, covering that portion of it seen in
<a href="#FigXXXVI02">Fig. 2</a> between the squares <span class="smcapall">F</span>,
<span class="smcapall">E</span>, <span class="smcapall">G</span>, <span class="smcapall">B</span> and
<span class="smcapall">E</span>, <span class="smcapall">H</span>, <span class="smcapall">B</span>,
<span class="smcapall">I</span>. This lid is fixed by means of
a close-gummed cloth hinge to the box at the dotted line <span class="smcapall">F</span>,
<span class="smcapall">E</span>. It is free every way
else, so that, when lifted up to an angle of forty-five
degrees, it keeps the light away from the ground-glass
top, and permits you to see the picture
thereon. This shade is, of course, also stained of
a dark colour internally.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXVI03">
<img src="images/illo358a.jpg" alt="camera obscura" width="300" height="176" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>Now your portable camera is complete. To
use it, all you have to do is to hold it in your
hand, with the lens turned towards the picture you
want represented, and the shade raised, then to
pull the focusing-drawer in and out till you have a
clear, well-defined picture on your ground-glass top. When the sun is shining
brightly the effect is charming; but you yourself and camera ought to be well in
the shade.</p>

<p>Now, the instrument I describe is very simple, but its principles may be
extended. You might have it on a stand with racks and pulleys for adjustment;
and you may have a dark cloth over the shade: the picture will then be ever so
much more bright. The great charm of a camera like this is to have a real and
lifelike picture in natural colours spread out before you, to see still life as it stands,
the trees waving in the wind, and flowers nodding in the sunshine, and every
human being or animal that passes walking and moving on your plate.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVII.&mdash;CARDBOARD-MODELLING AND WOOD
MODELLING.</h3>

<h4><span  class="fsize80">I.&mdash;HOW THE REEDHAM BOYS MAKE THEIR CARDBOARD MODELS.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">By the Head Master.</span></h4>

<p class="noindent">For some years it has been the custom for our boys to employ their leisure time
during the winter months in the construction of cardboard models of locomotives,
and some of the finished specimens exhibit a degree of skill and ingenuity which
could hardly be expected. The work, to a great extent, is the result of the boys&#8217;
own observation and skill, added to from time to time by those more observant or
more ingenious, and handed down traditionally from one generation of boys to
another.</p>

<p>As it is a very interesting occupation, and a valuable means of educating both
the eye and the hand, it occurred to me that, if it were possible to describe the
processes on paper, it would prove acceptable to boys generally. I therefore gladly
avail myself of the opportunity afforded me to lay before you, as clearly as I know
how, all the steps necessary to produce a finished model.</p>

<p>To encourage those who may underrate their powers, and think it is useless for
them to try, I would say that boys of nine, ten, and eleven often produce very
creditable work, and that those who produce the very best are not always those
most highly distinguished in class-work. A few more words only are necessary:
take these three &#8216;P&#8217;s.&#8217; as your helps, and I am sure you will succeed:</p>

<p>1. Be <span class="smcap">Precise</span>; that is, endeavour carefully to carry out every detail.</p>

<p>2. Be <span class="smcap">Patient</span>; that is, do not be too hasty in what you have to do.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Persevere</span>; if you fail at first, &#8216;Try, try, try again.&#8217;</p>

<p>We will commence by making a list of the materials required, all of which may
easily be obtained at a small cost. If two or three boys work together, the cost may
be reduced, as the smallest quantity you can purchase of some of the things will
suffice for more than one model.</p>

<h5 class="fsize80" id="ModMatList">MATERIALS.</h5>

<p><span class="padl1">1.</span> <i>Wood.</i>&mdash;One-eighth of an inch thick, straight in the grain, and of width and
length detailed afterwards. The backing of picture-frames, large cigar-boxes, boxes
in which cocoa or blacking is kept at the grocers&#8217; shops, all do capitally, and can
generally be got for nothing.</p>

<p><span class="padl1">2.</span> <i>Card.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Thick, (<i>b</i>) medium, and (<i>c</i>) thin. The thick may be obtained
from strong cardboard boxes; the thin can be bought at most stationers&#8217; in penny
sheets, about fourteen inches by ten; and for the medium obtain used postcards
(white), which answer the purpose capitally.</p>

<p><span class="padl1">3.</span> <i>Gum in solution.</i>&mdash;Make your own, by purchasing two ounces of gum-arabic
at one penny per ounce, and dissolving it with warm water till it is as thick as cream.
Do not put too much water at first, you can easily add more if too thick. Have
this always ready, for you require it constantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="padl1">4.</span> <i>Water-Colours</i> (Rowney&#8217;s or Reeve&#8217;s penny cakes).&mdash;Chrome green (2);
vermilion (1); ivory-black (1); and a little Chinese white (the last not essential).</p>

<p><span class="padl1">5.</span> <i>Camel-hair brushes.</i>&mdash;Three or four of various sizes, halfpenny and penny
each.</p>

<p><span class="padl1">6.</span> <i>Elastic bands.</i>&mdash;Six of various sizes.</p>

<p><span class="padl1">7.</span> <i>Pins.</i>&mdash;If you cannot beg from your mother or sister, one penny will buy
what is necessary.</p>

<p><span class="padl1">8.</span> <i>Sand-paper.</i>&mdash;Coarse and fine (halfpenny per sheet).</p>

<p><span class="padl1">9.</span> <i>Copper wire.</i>&mdash;Such as is used for bell-hanging. Cost, one penny, sufficient
for several.</p>

<p>10. <i>Crystal varnish.</i>&mdash;Cost,
twopence.</p>

<p>11. <i>Brass or steel chain.</i>&mdash;A
piece of a toy watch-chain does
very well.</p>

<p>12. <i>A few small pieces of
coal</i> from the coal-cellar, when
required.</p>

<p>13. <i>A knife</i>, with sharp
edge.&mdash;Boys need no advice on
this point.</p>

<p>14. <i>A cutting-board.</i>&mdash;Any
smooth piece of board about
half an inch thick.</p>

<p>15. <i>Cotton.</i>&mdash;One reel of
strong, any colour.</p>

<p>16. A few pieces of board
for painting and drying gummed
parts on. Such as described in
No. 1 will do.</p>

<p>When all your materials are
ready, select a piece of thin
wood (marked 1 in the <a href="#ModMatList">list</a> of materials). Let it be free from knots and straight
in the grain. The following dimensions are suitable for a medium-sized model; if
larger or smaller models are desired, increase or decrease proportionately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Length</span>, fourteen inches; <span class="smcap">Width</span>,
two and three-quarter inches; <span class="smcap">Thickness</span>,
about one-eighth of an inch; this is called the <span class="smcap">Foundation</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXVII01">

<p class="caption">Part of <a href="#FigXXXVII01">Fig. 1</a>.&mdash;Full size.</p>
</div>

<p>Having cut the exact size, next proceed to make on it, in pencil, the plan
as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
detailed in <a href="#FigXXXVII01">Fig. 1</a>, as follows: Rule the two
parallel lines <span class="smcapall">A E</span>, <span class="smcapall">B F</span>, at distances of a
quarter of an inch and three-eighths of an inch respectively from one edge; rule
<span class="smcapall">C G</span>, <span class="smcapall">D H</span> at
the same distances respectively from the other edge. Next measure off
from one end (which you had better mark &#8216;<span class="smcap">Front</span>&#8217;) half an inch, then one inch
and a quarter, one inch, one inch and three-quarters, etc., as on plan (this must be
done on both edges); rule lines across where the words &#8216;<span class="smcap">RAISE UP</span>,&#8217; 1, 2, 3, 4, are
marked. The shaded parts between the parallel lines should be shaded on your
plan as in the diagram. These shaded parts are now to be cut out with a sharp
knife. It requires both patience and care to prevent the wood splitting, but a
little practice will enable you to do this easily and skilfully. These cut-out spaces
(as will be seen afterwards) are for the wheels.</p>

<p>The <i>foundation</i> is now prepared, and the next process is to cut out four boiler
ends, or &#8216;Raise-ups,&#8217; as they are
termed, 1 and 2 for the front, 3 and
4 for the back of boiler. They are
all different, and are formed as
follows: On four pieces of thick card
(No. 2<i>a</i> in <a href="#ModMatList">list</a> of materials) describe
circles with radius one and one-eighth
of an inch (equal to half the distance
from <span class="smcapall">A D</span>); in Nos. 2 and 3 describe
a second circle, with radius not quite
a quarter of an inch less.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXVII02">
<img src="images/illo363.png" alt="" width="350" height="369" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.&mdash;&#8216;Raise-ups,&#8217; half the size.</p>
</div>

<p>Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 must each
have a base-line two inches and a
quarter long. The ends of Nos. 1
and 2 must curve up to meet the
circle, and Nos. 3 and 4 are perpendicular
lines from ends of base line
to meet the circle (as shown above
in <a href="#FigXXXVII02">Fig. 2</a>). Now place these on your
cutting-board (No. 14 in <a href="#ModMatList">list</a> of
materials) and with a very sharp
knife cut them neatly and carefully
the required shapes. Nos. 1 and 4 must be left quite whole in the centre; Nos. 2
and 3 must have their centres cut out round the inner circle. (In cutting do not try
to make a continuous cut, or your knife is almost certain to slip and spoil your
work; do it by successive &#8216;digs&#8217; with the point of the knife, in the manner
adopted by a gardener when cutting round the edges of a flower-bed with his spade.)</p>

<p>We are now in a position to make the body of the boiler. For this, take a
piece of <i>thin</i> card (2<i>c</i> in <a href="#ModMatList">list</a>);
it should be seven inches long (the length from <span class="smcapall">K</span> to
<span class="smcapall">L</span> in <a href="#FigXXXVII01">Fig. 1</a>), and about eight inches and a half wide. This must be rolled into a
cylinder, and is then ready for fitting into the &#8216;raise-ups&#8217; 2 and 3. No. 1 is then
placed at the front end and gummed on, and No. 4 at the other end and also
gummed on. No. 2 should be one and three-eighths of an inch from No. 1, and
No. 3 be one and seven-eighths of an inch from No. 4. These &#8216;raise-ups&#8217;
should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
now all be fixed in their places on the foundation, and fastened at the bottom edge
with the thick solution of gum (No. 3 in <a href="#ModMatList">list</a>), being held firmly to the foundation
by elastic bands (No. 6 in <a href="#ModMatList">list</a>). These bands must not be too strong or they will
flatten the boiler. In all gumming, pins should be freely stuck round to hold the
parts in the desired position until they are dry. Our model will now present <a href="#FigXXXVII03">this</a>
appearance. The short perpendicular lines with knobs marked <i>a</i> represent pins;
the lines marked <i>b</i> represent elastic bands.</p>

<p>When this is firmly stuck, two other pieces of thin card should be prepared to
connect the &#8216;raise-ups.&#8217; One must be one and three-eighths of an inch wide, and
the other one and seven-eighths of an inch, and long enough to reach from the
&#8216;foundation&#8217; on one side, over the top, to the &#8216;foundation&#8217; again on the other
side. They must exactly follow the shapes of the &#8216;raise-ups,&#8217; and should be cut to
exactly fit, but not before the previous work is quite dry and firm. When prepared,
gum in position; they are called &#8216;over-raise-ups.&#8217; Several folds of cotton must be
wound round the part marked <i>a b c d</i> to hold it while drying.</p>

</div>

<p>The next process is to well coat it with paint of the desired colour. If we are
copying one of the South-Eastern
Railway Company&#8217;s engines, the body
will have to be painted &#8216;chrome-green&#8217;;
if one of the Brighton Company&#8217;s,
it will have to be painted
&#8216;yellow-ochre.&#8217; As the latter is liable
to become soiled, we will select the
former, and commence by mixing our
colour. We shall require two penny cakes (No. 4 in <a href="#ModMatList">list</a> of materials). They
should be placed in a small tin or earthenware pot (one of Liebig&#8217;s extract-of-beef
pots answers the purpose admirably), a little water is then added,
and one of your cakes may easily be softened with a large paint-brush (No. 5
in <a href="#ModMatList">list</a>). Make your colour of the consistency of cream, so that it works freely.
It may be mixed while the previous work is drying. When all is ready, paint
the boiler and &#8216;over-raise-ups&#8217; evenly with it, and let it dry; a second coat
is applied in the same way, and usually a third and fourth coat. The front and
back &#8216;raise-ups&#8217; (Nos. 1 and 4) are not painted chrome-green. The body being
evenly painted, and dry, we proceed to ornament the boiler with some fine
lines; these are made by cutting with a sharp knife eight narrow strips of
paper, the exact width being, of course, very much a matter of taste. You
will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
require a ruler to guide your knife, and you must place your paper on something
smooth and very hard (not wood) while you cut, or the paper will curl up. These
strips must be about nine or ten inches long. Six are to be painted <i>black</i> and two
vermilion; immediately after painting them, just shift their position a little or the
edges will stick to the material on which they are laid, and they will break when
you attempt to lift them after they are dry. When dry, place them as follows:
First take a black strip, gum it, and stick it exactly midway between raise-ups
(Nos. 2 and 3) quite round the boiler; on each side of this, and about three-eighths
of an inch distant from it, gum a vermilion strip; next gum and place two black
strips similarly, one on each side, about an inch and a half distant from the centre
strip. The three remaining black strips are to be thus placed: one at the <i>front</i>
edge of the <i>front</i> &#8216;over-raise-up,&#8217; a second at the <i>back</i> edge of the same, the third at
the <i>front</i> of the <i>back</i> &#8216;over-raise-up;&#8217; the three last will then be exactly over the
raise-ups Nos. 1, 2, and 3. We now require two strips of card the exact length of
the space between Nos. 2 and 3 &#8216;raise-ups,&#8217; and not quite half an
inch wide; paint them well over with &#8216;chrome-green&#8217; like the
boiler, and when dry edge with a black line, using the smallest
paint-brush for this black line. These are to be gummed at the
lower side of the boiler touching the foundation, and meeting the
boiler obliquely, thus<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span>
<img src="images/illo365a.png" alt="model" width="100" height="103" class="inline" />.
The position of the strips is shown at <i>a</i>. In all gumming use plenty of gum, but
let the greater part be on the side hid from view.</p>

<p>We have now to construct &#8216;side-boxes.&#8217; Take a piece of medium thickness
card (a used <i>white</i> postcard), and make it the shape of <a href="#FigXXXVII05">Fig. 5</a>. Where the dotted

And by bringing the two edges of the groove together, thus,
<img src="images/illo365c.png" alt="model" width="50" height="55" class="inline" />,
you will be
enabled to fold the card at right angles at those places without breaking it.
Having cut this as required, it must be folded and gummed into shape (put
plenty of gum into the joints and corners), and kept in this position on a piece
of wood by pins.

When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
dry, paint &#8216;chrome-green,&#8217; edge with black, and gum in position one on each
side of the back &#8216;over-raise-up,&#8217; to which they should exactly fit. <a href="#FigXXXVII08">Fig. 8</a> shows
them in position marked <i>b</i>. The next thing to do is to
make &#8216;<span class="smcapall">MIDDLE-BOXES</span>.&#8217;
They are
two in number,
and are placed,
one on each side, exactly in the middle of the boiler, as
marked <i>a</i> in <a href="#FigXXXVII08">Fig. 8</a>. Medium thickness is required.
Describe a circle, with radius one inch; within and concentric
describe a second with radius seven-eighths of an
inch, and a third concentric with radius three-eighths of an
inch; divide this into two equal parts by the line <span class="smcapall">A B</span>,
<a href="#FigXXXVII07">Fig. 7</a>. Between the two inner circles draw radiating
spokes, as in <a href="#FigXXXVII07">Fig. 7</a>. Cut out the shaded parts neatly with
a sharp knife. Cut through the line <span class="smcapall">A B</span> to divide into two
parts. Now prepare two pieces of card shaped something
like <a href="#FigXXXVII05a">Fig. 5<i>a</i></a>; and the length must be sufficient to reach from
<span class="smcapall">A</span> to <span class="smcapall">B</span> round the outer
circle in <a href="#FigXXXVII07">Fig. 7</a>, the curve being made to fit nicely to the
boiler, as marked <i>c</i> in <a href="#FigXXXVII08">Fig. 8</a>. Gum these to

&#8216;chrome-green,&#8217; edged with black; gum middle-boxes in their places on the boiler.
In the centre of the front &#8216;raise-up&#8217; gum a circular piece of thin card (radius
three-quarters of an inch)&mdash;this represents soot-door; a pin,
with head and point cut off, gummed on the left side with
two narrow strips of card from the pin to beyond the circle
as annexed will form the hinges; two other pieces of pin,
as <a href="#FigXXXVII08a">shown</a> on the side opposite to the hinges, form the handles.</p>

<p>We have next to make a &#8216;<span class="smcapall">DOME-BOX</span>&#8217; and a <span class="smcapall">FUNNEL-BOX</span>.
As both of these are alike except in size, we will give
details of the first, and dimensions only of the second. On a
piece of &#8216;medium&#8217; card construct a square with sides one and a half inch long,
construct a second within it with sides one inch long, cut out the corners shaded,
leave the sides <span class="smcapall">A B</span> and <span class="smcapall">C D</span> straight, but curve, as
shown, the lines marked <span class="smcapall">E F</span> and <span class="smcapall">G H</span>, so that they
fit the boiler; the annexed (<a href="#FigXXXVII09">Fig. 9</a>, No. 1) is full size
and exactly the shape. All round the inner square,
where the dotted lines are shown, a <span class="lettsymb">V</span>-shaped groove
must be cut, as when making &#8216;side-boxes&#8217;: fold in,
gum well in at the angles, and place pins round to
keep it in position until
dry, as at <a href="#FigXXXVII09">Fig. 9</a>, No. 2.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the &#8216;funnel-box&#8217; are: outer square, one and a quarter inches
sides; inner square, three-quarters of an inch sides. The &#8216;dome-box&#8217; is to be
painted <i>chrome-green</i> and edged with black; the &#8216;funnel-box&#8217; is to be painted <i>black</i>.
When they are quite dry they must be gummed in position; the &#8216;dome-box&#8217; is to
be placed on the boiler, almost in the centre, but slightly nearer the front than the
back; the &#8216;funnel-box&#8217; exactly in the centre of the front over &#8216;raise-up.&#8217;</p>

<p>Now obtain a piece of deal about six inches long and rather more than an inch
square; the corners are to be cut away at one end, so that the end is shaped something
like a glass shade; then with sand-paper (<i>coarse</i> first and then <i>fine</i>) the
rounded part is smoothed; cut it off square, about one inch and a quarter from the
rounded end, as <a href="#FigXXXVII09a">shown</a> at <span class="smcapall">A B</span>.</p>

<p>This is the &#8216;<span class="smcapall">DOME</span>,&#8217; and if it be gilded with a little of Judson&#8217;s or Bessemer&#8217;s

on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
&#8216;dome-box;&#8217; it should exactly reach the centre of each side of the
square; looked at from above, it appears as at <a href="#FigXXXVII10"><i>a</i></a>; looked at from
one side, it appears as at <a href="#FigXXXVII10"><i>b</i></a>.</p>

<p class="caption">STEAM
FUNNEL</p>
</div>

<p>Next take a piece of rather stout note-paper, about six inches
long and half an inch wide, roll it round a piece of slate-pencil
several times, gum the outer end, and when dry slip it off;
cut a circular piece of medium card to fit the end, which
should be about half an inch in diameter; now roll another
piece of paper about a quarter of an inch wide so as to
make a roll about a third of the diameter of the preceding,
gum the outer end as before, and fix it in the centre of
the circular card; cut a second disc of card with the centre cut out just to fit on
the top of the small roll; it will then appear thus: It is called the &#8216;<i><a href="#FigXXXVII10a">steam-funnel</a></i>&#8217;;
it is to be painted &#8216;<i>chrome-green</i>&#8217; and edged with black; its position is the centre of
the back &#8216;over-raise-up.&#8217;</p>

<p>We must now make our <i>screen</i>. For this we require a piece of thick card
three and a half inches long and two and five-eighths inches wide. It is to be of
the shape <a href="#FigXXXVII11">here</a> given, but the width must be such that it will fit tightly in between
the side-boxes (see <i>b</i>, <a href="#FigXXXVII08">Fig. 8</a>) at the rear end of the boiler; the top must reach
about half an inch higher than the steam-funnel and be rounded at the corners.
In this two circular holes of about three-quarters of an inch in diameter must be
cut; their position is half an inch below the top and a quarter of an inch from the
sides; paint it chrome-green and edge with black. If pieces of circular glass, such
as are used for covering objects when mounted for the microscope, were placed
over the circular holes, and gilded round the edges, they would improve the
appearance; they are not essential. On this screen we now provide a circular
piece of thin card of the same diameter as the large end of boiler&mdash;viz.,
two and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
quarter inches; this must be painted black, and is then gummed on the screen so
as to correspond with the boiler end when the screen is in position; a hole,
horizontal at the top and circular below, of this shape and dimensions must now be
cut through both cards for an ash-pan, the lower edge being about one-eighth of an
inch from the edge of the circle; at the back, over the hole, gum a piece of paper
painted vermilion, and dotted with black to represent fallen cinders.</p>

<p>On this boiler end must now be made furnace and furnace-door. For this take
a piece of &#8216;medium&#8217; card, and on it describe a semi-circle, with diameter one and
three-quarter inches. In this make a door shaped as in the <a href="#FigXXXVII11b">diagram</a>, cut <i>quite</i>
through the part marked <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, except where the dotted line comes. Where
this dotted line is shown it should be cut on the <i>reverse</i> side of the card, <i>half</i>
through the card. This is the door, and it will then stand partly open. Round
the circular part gum a piece of thin card, one-eighth of an inch wide. Fasten
down with pins as before to dry, as annexed. When dry, paint the part which
is to show outside black, and stick a piece of paper painted vermilion on the inner
side of door. The vermilion should show through the partly open door, in order
to give the ruddy appearance of fire. This furnace end may now be gummed on
the boiler end (see <a href="#FigXXXVII11b">Fig. 11</a>). When in position the bottom will be parallel with
the top of the &#8216;ash-pan&#8217; opening, and about one eighth of an inch above
it. It will stand out from the boiler end. Now with a large pin make
holes all round the edge of the boiler end. They should be close
together, like this: <img src="images/illo369a.png" alt="model" width="75" height="50" class="inline" />.
In these holes insert pins, with the heads showing outside, and
this will give the effect of bright rivets.</p>

<p>Next take a piece of medium card, and make it of this size and shape:
<span class="inlinefigcapt"><span class="illo"><img src="images/illo369c.png" alt="" width="350" height="112" /></span>
<span class="capt">As seen from front.</span></span>.
Where
the dotted lines marked &#8216;1&#8217; are shown, bend it at right angles from you; where
the dotted lines marked &#8216;2&#8217; are shown, bend at right angles outwards; it will,
when looked at edgeways, appear like
this:
<span class="inlinefigcapt"><span class="illo"><img src="images/illo369b.png" alt="" width="300" height="40" /></span>
<span class="capt">As seen from above.</span></span>.
Paint it black on both sides, and
gum the ends (2 to 3) on the screen
just above the boiler end. The lever
(4, 5) is to work in this on its centre (4). A narrow piece of thick card, about
one inch and a quarter long, will do
for the lever, while a pin inserted at
4 forms the centre on which it
moves.</p>

<p>We then fix our &#8216;<i>steam-gauge</i>.&#8217;
It consists of a
circular piece of
white <i>medium</i>
card, on which is shown the numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, etc., to
indicate the pressure. A pin through the centre connects it with
the steam-funnel. The pin represents the steam-pipe. We now
require taps, which we make out of pins, by cutting off the heads
and bending them at right angles about one-eighth of an inch from
the headless end. The point is pushed through the card, leaving outside about
one-eighth of an inch in addition to the bent part, as shown in accompanying <a href="#FigXXXVII11c">cut</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Above this we gum another piece of bent pin <i>this</i> size
<img src="images/illo370a.png" alt="model" width="63" height="40" class="inline" /> and shape, for handle
of tap. Two or three of these should be placed on the boiler end, at the
left side above the furnace.</p>

<p>Our screen will now appear as shown at <a href="#FigXXXVII11">Fig. 11</a>, and is ready for fixing. To
enable us to do this, as its position is at the back end of the boiler, we first remove
entirely No. 4 &#8216;<i>raiseup</i>&#8217; and this must be done very carefully. A good plan is to
cut out the bottom of the &#8216;raiseup,&#8217; insert your finger and gently pull it, when, with
a little coaxing, it will probably come out easily. The &#8216;raiseup&#8217; being removed, we
fix the screen firmly in its place, using plenty of gum on the inner side of the &#8216;over-raiseup,&#8217;
&#8216;side-boxes,&#8217;
and inner boiler end.
To hold it in position
while drying, stick
two or three pins at
the bottom into the
&#8216;foundation,&#8217; and tie
a piece of cotton
through the screen
holes round the dome.
This cotton must not
be so tight as to pull
off the dome or bend
the screen. Let it
dry.</p>

<p>The next process
is to provide &#8216;<i>tender-sides</i>.&#8217;
The name
indicates what they
are, viz. sides to the
tender. They are
made of wood; two pieces, each four and a half inches long, one inch and a
quarter wide, and one-eighth of an inch thick, are required. The upper corner at
the front end should be cut out to correspond with the projection from side-boxes
(see <a href="#FigXXXVII05">Fig. 5</a>, <i>a</i>). Paint chrome-green, edged with black, then divide into panels
with black lines, as at <a href="#FigXXXVII12">Fig. 12</a>, which is full size, and
gives the exact appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
If found too difficult, omit all the inner lines. It is advisable to practise making
these fine lines on a piece of paper before making them on your &#8216;sides.&#8217;</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXVII13">

<p>When they are quite ready they are placed in position (one on each side) at the
rear of the &#8216;foundation,&#8217; and firmly gummed. They must be in an exact line with
the &#8216;side-boxes,&#8217; and reach a little each way beyond the pair of tender-wheels (as
shown in <a href="#FigXXXVII01">Fig. 1</a>, <span class="smcapall">P</span> to
<span class="smcapall">R</span>). To connect these, take a piece of &#8216;thick&#8217; card of the
shape shown (<a href="#FigXXXVII13">Fig. 13</a>, <i>a</i>). The diagram is half
size. At <span class="smcapall">M O</span> and <span class="smcapall">N P</span>, cut, as before
explained, V-shaped grooves, and gum up the shape as at <a href="#FigXXXVII13">Fig. 13</a>, <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>Paint the part marked <span class="smcapall">A</span> chrome-green; panel with black lines like sides of
tender. Paint the parts marked <span class="smcapall">B</span> and
<span class="smcapall">C</span> black. When quite dry, place in position;
the part marked <span class="smcapall">A</span> is to be at the back end of the &#8216;tender-sides&#8217; connecting them,
the part marked <span class="smcapall">B</span> half-way along the top, in both cases extending to the <i>outer edge</i>
of the wooden &#8216;tender-sides.&#8217; The part marked <span class="smcapall">C</span>, which is narrower, comes <i>between</i>

rounded, and with two holes near the top similar to those in the &#8216;screen.&#8217;
Near the bottom a hole, one inch wide and three-quarters of an inch high, should be
cut&mdash;this is for the stoker to get coals out. The diagram (<a href="#FigXXXVII14">Fig. 14</a>) gives the shape.
Paint chrome-green, and edge with black.</p>

<p>If you desire to make a screen with a top to it, as in the engines more recently
constructed, obtain a piece of thick card long enough for both screens (which now
must be of equal height) and the top; arrange it something like the annexed figure,
placing all the details of both screens as before described, and finally making V-shaped
grooves at <span class="smcapall">A</span> and <span class="smcapall">B</span>, where the bends are to be made. Gum up into shape
and afterwards gum in position as before described. Very often this kind of engine
has no &#8216;tender,&#8217; and is called a &#8216;tank&#8217; engine.</p>

<p>Now obtain some coal and break it into small pieces&mdash;about the size of
gum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
arabic when purchased. These are to be gummed on the card marked <span class="smcapall">C</span>, in <a href="#FigXXXVII13">Fig. 13</a>
to fill the space level between it and the back screen, and thus give the appearance
of a tender well filled with coal. The tender will now be as represented at <a href="#FigXXXVII15">Fig. 15</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Our attention must now be given to the <i>wheels</i>. We require five pairs. The
diameter of these should be equal to the spaces cut out on the &#8216;foundation&#8217; in
<a href="#FigXXXVII01">Fig. 1</a>, viz. one pair one inch and a quarter, one pair (fly-wheels) one inch and
three-quarters, and three pairs one inch and a half. They are to be cut out of
&#8216;thick&#8217; card; the fly-wheels should have sixteen <i>spokes</i>, the others may have eight
or twelve. In the centre of each wheel make a pin-hole. <a href="#FigXXXVII16">Fig. 16</a>, full size, will
show you how to mark and cut out your wheels. The shaded part is to be cut out
neatly and carefully with a sharp knife. As each wheel is cut out, paint it chrome-green,
and edge each spoke with black. Next obtain a piece or pieces of wood
about three-eighths of an inch square at the end, and about one or two feet long.
Cut off five pieces, each two inches and a quarter long&mdash;this is probably rather
longer than required, but they can be cut shorter; they are for <i>axles</i>, and the ends
should be painted black.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXVII16a">

<img src="images/illo372d.png" alt="model" width="600" height="50" />
<p class="caption">Bearing shaft complete, quarter of size.</p>
</div>

<p>Having all these prepared, fix each pair of wheels to an axle by sticking a pin
through a pin-hole. They are not to be permanently fixed until the axles are stuck
on the foundation, as possibly some of the pins may require to be placed higher or
lower in the axles in order that all the wheels may be level at the bottom and the
engine stand firmly
when on a smooth
surface. When this
is done, fasten the
wheels very firmly
to the axles with
pins cut in half.
I should add, the
wheels are <i>not</i> intended
to revolve.
Next provide &#8216;bearing-shafts&#8217; by taking strips of thin card, the same length as
the foundation, and about half an inch wide; draw a line down the the
middle of each from end to end. Now fit them to the sides in order to
mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
on them the positions of the engine-wheel centres, <span class="smcapall">A</span>,
<span class="smcapall">B</span>, <span class="smcapall">C</span>. At these make
curves, as <a href="#FigXXXVII16a">shown</a>. Cut through the line (1,2); it follows the centre line except at
the curves; the bottom is quite straight. Paint this &#8216;vermilion,&#8217; or better still,
&#8216;crimson-lake,&#8217; and edge with white. The bearing shafts are continued round the
ends front and rear, but for these it is best to take separate pieces of card of medium
thickness; they are only a quarter of an inch wide; paint and edge like the side
pieces. Gum in position on the sides and ends of foundation; only the curved
parts at <span class="smcapall">A</span>, <span class="smcapall">B</span>,
<span class="smcapall">C</span> appear above, the straight part of the upper edge is &#8216;flush&#8217; (that is,
exactly even) with the <i>foundation</i>.</p>

<p>Our copper wire (No. 9 in <a href="#ModMatList">list</a>) is now needed. Cut two pieces just long enough
to fit <i>tightly</i> between the second and third &#8216;raiseups,&#8217; fix them in position parallel
with boiler, rather more than half-way up, and near the edge of the &#8216;raiseups.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamps</span> are now to be made and fixed on the space in front; they are best made
out of pieces of wood&mdash;the remainder of that used for axles will be useful for this if
cut down; they should be about three-eighths of an inch wide and thick, and half
an inch high. Paint the front side of one white, of the other green; when dry,
make a circle on this front, and paint <i>all black except within the circles</i>; make two
similar for the back, but these paint <i>vermilion</i> for the <i>centres</i>. In the top of each
insert a bent pin with its head cut off for a handle.</p>

<p>Now make the buffers, the instructions for
making steam-funnel will tell you how: the only
difference is that there is to be <i>no hole</i> in the
circular card at the end. The front part is painted
vermilion, the rest black. Two are required
at each end; they are placed on the bearing-shafts
front and rear, about three-eighths of an inch from the sides.</p>

<p>The &#8216;<span class="smcapall">FUNNEL</span>&#8217; now requires our attention. It is made of paper, long enough
and wide enough, when tightly rolled, to form a cylinder about
half an inch in diameter and two inches long. Gum the edge
down. For the top, cut a circular ring, of medium card, three-quarters
of an inch in diameter outside, half an inch in diameter
inside. Fit this neatly on the top of the cylinder. Paint it black and
gum in the centre of the funnel-box, previously described. A gold
line or strip of gilt paper round the top of the funnel improves the
appearance.</p>

<p>A circular piece of medium card three-quarters of an inch in diameter, with a black

<p><i>Safety-valves</i>, connected with the &#8216;dome,&#8217; should now be put. Obtain two
rather thick sewing-needles, about two inches long; make with the points two small
holes, one-eighth of an inch apart, just behind the red strip at the back of the
&#8216;dome;&#8217; push the eye end of one of these needles carefully through these holes, so
as to allow them to stand out about an inch and a half. They should incline to
each other at the top, but otherwise be perpendicular. They are connected with
the dome by pins with the heads cut off, but whose points are stuck into a little cube
of cork gummed on the top of the dome.</p>

<p>The engine is now tolerably complete, and only requires to be varnished.
For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
this purpose, obtain some &#8216;crystal&#8217; varnish, of good quality, and apply it with a
large camel-hair brush. One good coat should suffice. Let it thoroughly dry before
handling.</p>

<p>There are many little details which will probably occur to you. I have seen a
metal cartridge-case used to represent a cylinder, a wire coming from the top
representing the steam feed-pipe. Little pieces of chain, front and back, represent
coupling-chains. In some, the apparatus for applying the vacuum brake is imitated.
All you need do is to use your eyes and exercise your ingenuity. Should you fail
at first, do not be discouraged; try once more. There are no obstacles but what
may be conquered by patient and persevering attention.</p>

<p>The humming-top is a familiar toy that does not cost much to buy. At the same
time there is always a satisfaction in making a thing for oneself&mdash;particularly when
it costs nothing.</p>

<p>As it happens that a good loud humming-top can be made for nothing, we feel
sure that some of our readers will not be above
trying their hands at it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXVIIa">
<img src="images/illo374.jpg" alt="humming-top" width="350" height="441" />
</div>

<p>The materials are an empty baking-powder
canister, or any wooden box, and two pieces of firewood.
The plan of operations is to cut a slit in the
side of the box answering to the hole in the toy,
making it half an inch square or round, as the case
may be, and making a hole in the lid and bottom of
the box for the spindle to come through. To make
a good job of it the bottom hole should be square
and the top hole round, and the spindle should be
cut to fit, pushing it in, of course, from the bottom.
When the holes and spindle are cut, put a little glue
round the lid to make the box tight, and insert the
spindle with a little glue at each hole. For the usual
fork or handle with which the top is spun, a plain
slip of wood with a hole at the end will be found to answer.</p>

<p>Very simple preparations all these, and yet everything is ready except the
string.</p>

<p>When the top is dry, wind round the string, passing it through the hole in the
handle as <a href="#FigXXXVIIa">shown</a>, and spin.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVIII.&mdash;ARTIFICIAL WOOD: HOW TO MAKE IT AND
WHAT TO MAKE OF IT.<br />
<span class="smcap">By the late Dr. Scoffern.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">You will admit, I think, that if instead of fashioning wood by tools it were
possible to make the wood grow into the shape desired, it would not only be
curious, but under certain circumstances useful. Suppose, for instance, I
wished to have a boat; it would not only be curious, but in some cases useful,
if I could make the boat grow under my eyes by almost imperceptible
additions, instead of fashioning it, as now, from planks. This is just what
I am going to show you how to do, and very pretty work you will find it in long
evenings.</p>

<p>You must begin by making a fluid called cupro-ammonium (you cannot buy it),
which has the singular property of dissolving woody matter just as completely as
water dissolves gum. You make this cupro-ammonium thus: Go to a wholesale
druggist, or a drysalter, and purchase a Winchester quart bottle full of the very
strongest solution of ammonia. This is known commercially as &#8216;eighty-eighty&#8217;
ammonia, by which name you are to inquire for it. Were you to purchase less
than the measure of a Winchester quart it would cost you a much higher proportionate
price, because, being very irritating to the nose and eyes, the vendor will
take good care to charge you for all the sneezes and eye-blinkings he has to
encounter in measuring out your required quantity.</p>

<p>Next you will require an <i>empty</i> Winchester quart stoppered bottle, or a bottle of
equal capacity. Being thus provided, you will pour just one
half of the contents of the full bottle into the empty bottle;
the reason for doing which will presently be seen.</p>

<p>Get now some copper wire&mdash;it matters not what size&mdash;and
having got it, cut into such lengths that being thrust
into one of your half-full Winchester quart bottles it shall lie
partly immersed in the ammonia, and partly exposed to air,
like this<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXVIII01">
<img src="images/illo375.jpg" alt="bottle" width="200" height="303" />
</div>

<p>You will observe that the <a href="#FigXXXVIII01">sketch</a> represents not one length
of copper wire, but many, the fact being that the object of
using copper at all is that it may be dissolved by the ammonia;
and it stands to reason that in proportion as the copper
is more so will the necessary strength of solution be arrived
at more quickly. Contact of air being necessary to effect the solution affords
the reason for your dividing the original ammonia into halves.</p>

<p>So your bundle of copper wire being placed in the half-full bottle as described,
there let it remain and steep, but you must take care to remove the stopper of your
bottle from time to time&mdash;say once a day, at least&mdash;shaking the contained fluid
well about, so as to promote air contact. An interesting change will be seen
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
take place. The ammonia solution, originally colourless as water, grows blue
and bluer still, until so very blue that you cannot see through it. To this
blue solution the name of cupro-ammonia has been applied. It has the
remarkable property of dissolving wood, as we shall presently discover in our
workings.</p>

<p>Before going further I must point out to you that this cupro-ammonium has a
very strong smell; not a disagreeable smell, far from it; the smell of hartshorn, in
point of fact. Not an unhealthy smell, but one may easily have too much of it.
To be working amidst sneezing and eyes full of water is not agreeable, so I will tell
you betimes how, in your small workings, you may avoid this inconvenience. The
smell depends on a colourless gas ammonia, which is a light gas and very tractable.
If you sit in a draught and on the windward side whilst working, and in the open
air, the ammonia is blown away from you and you smell nothing. If you work in a
room and before a chimney, up which there is a draught, then again you smell
nothing, because all the ammonia evolved goes up the chimney. These points
being remembered, no trouble will be experienced in doing such small work as I
shall teach you; but before working with cupro-ammonia could be conducted on a
large manufacturing scale, as it now is conducted, special means had to be devised
for disposing of the ammoniacal atmosphere.</p>

<p>Good, so far! And now about the tools. The hand, with its four fingers and
a thumb, is so excellent a tool for an infinity of purposes, that certain thoughtless
people would seem to be under the impression that whatever new thing they may
have to do can be done without tools altogether. This is a mistake; tools you will
want, but they are of the simplest description.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as cupro-ammonium not only stains the skin but irritates it, do not let
it touch the skin. There is no danger in the matter, only inconvenience. You do
not want the ladies of your family petulantly complaining about those boys having
been &#8216;dabbling with their filthy chemicals.&#8217; Should your fingers get stained, a little
vinegar will get out the stain, but not without a certain smarting that may as well
be avoided.</p>

<p>The chief tool you will have to employ will be a finger of the right hand.
Some operators may prefer the forefinger to others; the second will come most
natural. But whichever finger you determine to employ, case it in india-rubber.
This is easily done, and as follows: Having procured a sheet of raw or
unvulcanised india-rubber, cut a piece off, hold out your finger, and get some
friend, after warming the rubber, to stretch it over the
finger so<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span><img src="images/illo376.jpg" alt="finger-stall"
width="171" height="100" class="inline" id="FigXXXVIII02" />
squeezing the rubber where it comes round
the finger above into a flattened crest. The two surfaces
will stick together quite as much as is desirable.
Now let the operator, with a pair of sharp scissors, and at
one sweep, cut away the crest close up to the finger.
You will then have an india-rubber finger-stall.</p>

<p>If you choose to be a little more extravagant, you may provide yourself with an
india-rubber glove. Gloves of this material are common enough now, being used
for a variety of purposes, more especially by photographers for protecting their
hands against the corrosive and poisonous agents employed in the practice
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
photography. If, however, you do use gloves, see that they are thin, fitting well to
the fingers. If thick they will interfere with the delicacy of touch necessary to
your working. For my part, I do not recommend gloves, looking upon a finger-stall
of india-rubber as superior.</p>

<p>The next tool that you must get is a pair of forceps, such as watchmakers use.
It is a very inexpensive instrument, costing only a few pence, and in shape
it is like this<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXVIII03">
<img src="images/illo377a.png" alt="forceps" width="29" height="200" />
</div>

<p>The next tool&mdash;and the last I shall have to indicate&mdash;is
a pair of sharp and delicately made scissors. Do not calculate on family
resources, taking the first pair of scissors that may come to hand: get a pair
of your own. See that they are first-rate when you are about it, and you cannot
buy scissors of this sort at random at any hardware shop. Go to a surgical
instrument shop, where you will be able to get what you want.</p>

<p>And now I leave your cupro-ammonium to brew, and you to get together
the few tools indicated. When you are quite ready, we will proceed to see
what to do with it.</p>

<p>The first exercise I shall put to you is the manufacture of an artificial
wooden bottle. There will be no particular use in the thing when made, but it
will be a curiosity, and the making of it is the very best exercise that suggests
itself to me after many years&#8217; experience.</p>

<p>You will perhaps here call to mind what I have told you about the pungent
smell of our working fluid, cupro-ammonium, if one chances to get a sniff at it, and
how that inconvenience may be avoided by a little management. In addition to
that memory, please now bear in mind that the intensity of the smell of odorous
things is in proportion to the surface exposed. Presently, in order to use your
cupro-ammonium fluid, some must be poured out into a vessel into which you can
dip little pieces of paper. Now it is evident that the smell of a pint of cupro-ammonium,
or of any other smelling fluid, will be less intense if the vessel be a comparatively
narrow-mouthed jug than if it be a basin; but supposing a basin to be
desirable for collateral reasons, then much smell may be avoided by providing yourself
with a temporary cover, say a glass pane, which may be laid over the surface,
resting on the basin rim at the intervals when the dipping of your pieces of paper
must be interrupted.</p>

<p>Next as to the paper you are to use in making this bottle of artificial wood. The
best for your purpose will be what is known as printing demy. Writing-paper,
having a glazed surface, is not favourable. The glaze is produced by animal size, a
material that does not go well with cupro-ammonium. It
matters little, practically nothing at all, whether the printer&#8217;s
demy be new or whether it be printed upon. I have made
excellent artificial wood out of, I believe, <i>all</i> the London
daily morning papers; so choose your paper, and let us fall
to work. Theoretically and scientifically it matters not what
shape you cut your paper into, but practically, and present
purpose regarded, there can be no doubt but that discs of a
circular shape, and scored with cuts all round the circumference,
are most convenient. The discs may conveniently run about the accompanying
size.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXVIII04">
<img src="images/illo377b.png" alt="disc" width="200" height="200" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>The basis or model of our bottle about to be, or rather flask, shall be a common
oil-flask. Provide yourself, then, with one of these, and cleanse it thoroughly from
all oil, the least touch of which would be fatal to the success of our workings.
Having done this, provide some sort of stand, into which the neck of the flask being
stuck, the whole may be turned round and round in the progress
of working. It matters nothing what this movable stand is. A
candlestick does very well, if you can find a candlestick with
candle-socket big enough to admit the neck of the flask. A
marmalade pot holding sand can always be got, and into the sand
the mouth and neck of the flask being stuck, every necessary
purpose will have been answered.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXVIII05">
<img src="images/illo378a.jpg" alt="stand" width="150" height="289" />
</div>

<p>Preliminaries being thus seen to, you pour out some of the
cupro-ammonium in, let us say, a basin. Do not be sparing as to
the quantity you pour out, for a reason to be explained presently.
Take now one of your paper circular discs, and, with your forceps
nipping it quite at the edge, dip it into the cupro-ammonium bath.
For how long? Ah! that is a question to be solved. Assuming
your stock of cupro-ammonium to be in good working order&mdash;assuming it to have
been brewing with the copper wire for not less than a month, air having been
furnished to it day by day, as already enjoined&mdash;then about three seconds will be
long enough for each immersion. Nothing but practice will settle the point, and
after only a little practice the operator cannot be mistaken. Immerse, then, for
trial a paper disc, and, withdrawing it after about three or four
seconds, lay it upon the crown of your flask and spread it out
regularly by means of your forceps and rubber-protected finger.
If it feels slippery like an eel the fluid has come to condition; but
otherwise, if the disc instead of feeling slippery give the impression
of harshness, then the conditions are not all
that one would desire them to be. The main
question is this: will the next disc, when steeped
in the bath, removed, and pressed down, stick
satisfactorily to the preceding disc?</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXVIII06">
<img src="images/illo378b.jpg" alt="flask" width="150" height="280" />
</div>

<p>This we shall now see. I have shown you
<a href="#FigXXXVIII06">here</a> how the discs must overlap each other like
the scales of a fish. You need not be particular
in aiming at the mathematical symmetry of the scale lying on a
fish&#8217;s skin; it would be folly to attempt such a result except your
discs had been mathematically cut to pattern, and extremely difficult
of execution in any case. Supposing the adhesion to be
satisfactory, you can go on covering the entire surface of the oil-flask,
and I should think common sense would suggest that when
you have come down a certain distance in your working it will be more convenient
if you take the flask out of its support and reverse it on a tumbler thus<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXVIII07">
<img src="images/illo378c.jpg" alt="flask" width="150" height="326" />
</div>

<p>When one course of overlap disc-layering has been finished in the way described,
I would advise you, this being your first experience, to lay your work aside and let
it dry. It will be easy now to see whether the overlap adhesion by all that
was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
desired, and what the process is capable of. You are to remember, please, that
we aim at no mere sticking together comparable to the result of gumming or
pasting, but to an actual incorporation of material, so that junction being once
effected, the layers can never more be separated by any known means. Were
it otherwise, a thick material resulting from aggregated sheets of paper would have
no claim to the designation &#8216;artificial wood.&#8217; It would be simply <i>papier-mach&eacute;</i>,
reducible to paper pulp by mere steeping in water; whereas the material you and
I are now engaged upon may be not only steeped in water, but actually boiled, and
will never come to pieces. It will behave under those circumstances exactly like
natural wood&mdash;that is to say, will soften a little to a certain depth, no more.</p>

<p>Cupro-ammonium is a very funny thing to work with, and has many curious
ways. One curious point is this: Capable of effecting such complete adhesion&mdash;nay,
more, incorporation, actual, bodily, as we have seen it to be&mdash;yet that quality
ceases after only a few minutes&#8217; removal from the bath. If you ask me the why
and wherefore, frankly, I am unable to tell you, not myself knowing, though I have
worked at this material for more than twenty years. So whatever work has to be
done with cupro-ammonium has to be quickly done.</p>

<p>Another point of very highest importance is the following: Do you remember my
telling you not to be sparing in the quantity of cupro-ammonium poured from the
&#8216;brewing bottle,&#8217; as we will call it, into the dipping basin? The fact is that every bit
of paper you immerse and withdraw weakens the original solvent power of the bath,
so in proportion as the bath liquor is smaller in quantity, by so much more speedily
will its working power be lessened. For a long time that working power can be,
and in practice is, restored by additional copper steepage, but it cannot be restored
indefinitely.</p>

<p>Now pour back your bath-liquor; put away your tools, hereafter to renew your
bottle building. Go on adding layer to layer until your bottle is as thick as you
wish it to be, then giving the thing a sharp crack with the hammer, the glass flask
will crumble almost to sand, which, when shook out, your own flask of cuproxylene,
or artificial wood, will remain without support, but quite able to take care of itself.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">How to Make an Astronomical Telescope.</span><br />
BY FRANK CHASEMORE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The investigation of astronomical phenomena can only be made with the aid of a
good telescope, the purchase of which is attended with considerable cost. It is
my purpose in this chapter to give such directions as will enable any boy with average
ingenuity to make for himself, at the cost of a few shillings, an instrument with
which he can observe the more interesting of these phenomena.</p>

<p>This telescope will be of the simple non-achromatic class&mdash;that is, the colour
effect of the unequal refraction of light is not corrected. Object-glasses of the
achromatic construction are very
expensive. All refracting telescopes
were of the simple class up to
1758, when Mr. John Dollond,
who had a few years before set up
in business in London as optician,
discovered a way to correct the
colour effect on the image. This
was by making the object-glass
compound, or of two or more
lenses fitted to each other, each
being made of a different quality of
glass from the other and having a
different refracting power, one lens
correcting or neutralising the dispersing
caused by the other. The
lenses for our telescope can be
had from Messrs. Dollond and Co.,
descendants of the above John
Dollond, No. 1, Ludgate Hill, who
have given me some valuable hints
with regard to the construction of
this telescope.</p>

<p>A refracting telescope consists
of an eye-piece, a tube, and an
object-glass; these are mounted on
a firm stand. The object-glass at
one end of the tube collects the rays of light, reflected from an object, to a point,
in the focus of the eyepiece, which magnifies the image that is there formed,
enabling the eye, placed at the orifice of the eyepiece, to see an enlarged image
of the object.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXIX01">

<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>The stand must be firm, so as not to vibrate when any one passes along the
floor of the room, and it must have a vertical and lateral motion connected with it.
<a href="#FigXXXIX01">Fig. 1</a> shows what our instrument will be like when finished.</p>

<p>The first thing to be made is the tube; this must be thirty-nine inches long and
two inches in diameter inside. Get a wooden roller four feet long and two inches
wide. A piece of curtain rod will do. Now mix some strong glue. If you have
not a glue-pot, mix it in a jar placed in a saucepan of water. Get some sheets of
stout brown paper and well damp them. Take a strip of brown paper, that has not
been damped, thirty-nine inches long and seven inches wide. Rub the roller all
over well with powdered chalk and put this dry paper strip round it to form a case,
lapping and gluing the edges together, but being very careful not to let any glue
touch the roller. Now take your damped paper and rub it all over on both sides
with hot glue, and roll it on the roller; roll it tightly and rub the glue well in, and
rub each layer of paper well in to the under one, so that when dry it will form a
mass of paper and glue. Put on enough paper to form a casing a quarter of an
inch thick. When you have done papering set the whole on one side to get quite
dry and hard. While this is drying we can be making the eyepiece and stand. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
the eyepiece we shall want a piece of brass tube four inches long and large enough
for the larger of the two lenses that form the eyepiece to go inside; that will be a
little more than an inch in diameter inside. Get your lenses before getting the tube.
This tube can be bought at the ironmonger&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Now for the lenses. Go to Messrs. Dollond and ask for a two-inch simple
object-glass, forty inches focus. This will be one shilling and sixpence. For the
eyepiece ask for two plano-convex lenses&mdash;one of one-inch focus, the other of
two-inch focus. These will be three shillings and sixpence the pair. The object
glass is to be double convex. Now, having got your lenses, we will fix them in the
tube.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXIX02">
<img src="images/illo381a.jpg" alt="telescope" width="350" height="128" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>

<p>Cut a piece of cardboard three-quarters of an inch wide, and long enough to go
all round inside the tube tightly, and not to lap. Push this in to form a lining at
one end, and forming a shelf out of the thickness. This shelf is to be about two
inches from the end. Now turn the other end of the tube up and drop the larger
of the two lenses&mdash;which is called the field lens&mdash;on to the shelf with the rounded
side downwards. Now push in on the top of it another cardboard lining three-quarters
of an inch wide. Push this lining quite down on to the flat side of the lens
to keep it firm. On to the shelf formed by this lining place a disc of cardboard the
size of the inside of the tube, and with a hole cut in the centre half an inch in
diameter. This hole must be cut quite clean. On to this disc push in a cardboard
lining one inch wide to keep all firm. Now cut two discs of cardboard, one the exact
size of the inside of the tube, with a hole in the centre a trifle smaller in diameter
than the small lens, which is called the eye-lens; the other a quarter of an inch
smaller, and having a hole in the centre the exact size of the eye-lens. Glue these
two discs together (as in <a href="#FigXXXIX02">Fig. 2</a>), being careful to get them concentric. When this
is dry push the eye-lens into the ledge formed, the flat side downwards, and put the
cardboard discs on to the lining in the tube, the rounded side of the glass inside the
tube. Fasten the disc and lens in place with a narrow strip of cardboard, going all
round just inside the tube.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 4.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#FigXXXIX03">Fig. 3</a> will show the arrangement of lenses and disc in the tube. The lenses
are to be an inch and three-quarters from edge to edge; the disc is to be an inch
from the eye-lens. Now get a tinman to make you a cap of thin brass plate (like
<a href="#FigXXXIX04">Fig. 4</a>). This is to fit tightly on the end of the tube over the eye-lens, and is to
have a hole in the centre of the top three-eighths of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>Now the eyepiece is finished, and we will get on with the stand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXIX05">

<p class="caption">Fig. 5.</p>
</div>

<p>Let two circular pieces of beech five inches in diameter and one and a half
inches thick, each to have a hole bored in the centre an inch in diameter, and going
right through the wood. Take one of these pieces, and on the under side fasten,
by three strong brass hinges that work stiffly, three legs, made of inch and a half
square pine (<a href="#FigXXXIX05">Fig. 5</a>). These legs are to be four feet six inches long.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXIX06">
<img src="images/illo383a.jpg" alt="telescope" width="200" height="373" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 6.</p>
</div>

<p>Take the other piece of beech and fasten a rod or roller of wood, two feet and
a half long and one inch diameter, into the hole, so that one end is flush with the
top side of the wood (<a href="#FigXXXIX06">Fig. 6</a>). Now fasten two uprights to the top, letting them
into the wood (<a href="#FigXXXIX06">Fig. 6</a>). These are to be three-quarters of an inch thick, and four
and a half inches high, and are to be three and a half inches apart.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXIX07">
<img src="images/illo383b.png" alt="telescope" width="350" height="197" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.</p>
</div>

<p>Bore a hole in each upright about half an inch from the top and about
one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
quarter of an inch in diameter. Now get nine screw stair-eyes at the ironmonger&#8217;s,
and about seven feet of brass wire one eighth of an inch thick. Get this wire
straightened. Into the inside of each leg, and one foot from the top, screw one of
the brass stair-screws. Now get a piece of wood,
circular, three inches diameter and one and a half
inches thick (a ribbon roller will do very well), and
bore a hole right through the centre, one and a
quarter inches in diameter. Round this piece of
wood at equal distances screw three more of the
screw-eyes. Now cut from your brass wire three
lengths of fourteen inches, and turn a ring at each
end of each piece, and
hook one end of each piece into a screw-eye in the
circular block, and the other end into the eye in
each leg, closing up the rings so that they will not
come unhooked. This arrangement will keep the
top from tilting. Now the stand is finished, and we
will take the tube in hand if it is quite dry and
hard. Before drawing out the roller, cut the ends
off quite square with a sharp knife, leaving the
tube thirty-seven and a half inches long. Now draw
out the roller without breaking the tube. We must
next fix the object-glass. Cut a strip of cardboard
half an inch wide, and long enough to go all round
inside the tube without lapping, and to fit tightly.
Push this inside, so that it will form a shelf half an
inch inside the end of the tube. Glue this in its
place. Upon this place the object-glass, and fix it
there by gluing a strip of cardboard all round inside
the tube on the top of the lens. To fix the eyepiece,
cut from the roller used to make the tube on, a piece
one inch long, and bore a hole right through the
centre of it the exact size of the eyepiece tube.
Glue this block in the other end of tube. Push the brass tube in this hole with
the field-lens inwards. The telescope can be focussed by pushing in or
drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
out the brass tube. Get a piece of deal eight inches long and three and a half
inches wide and two inches deep. Cut a groove along the top as <a href="#FigXXXIX07">Fig. 7</a>, one inch
deep and a little more than two and a quarter inches wide, to fit the outside of the
tube. Glue this block on the tube, so that one end is thirteen inches from the front
end of the tube (the eyepiece end). Put the block in its place between the uprights
on the stand, and fix it there by two screws passing through the holes in the
uprights and screwing into the block. Pass the rod attached to the uprights through
the hole in the top of stand and through the hole in the block underneath.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXXXIX08">
<img src="images/illo383c.png" alt="telescope" width="250" height="409" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 8.</p>
</div>

<p>Now we have only to make the arrangement for elevating the telescope. For
this you will want the
rest of the brass wire and
the remaining three stair-eyes
as well as two pieces
of thin brass plate, four
and a half inches long,
half an inch wide, and
one-sixteenth of an inch
thick. Bend these pieces
of plate as in <a href="#FigXXXIX08">Fig. 8</a>,
making the bent parts
one inch long, and get
the ends cut as in the
figure, and have holes
drilled in the bent parts
a little larger than the
brass wire. Cut your
wire into two lengths of
eighteen and a half
inches, and take them to
the tinman and get him
to cut a screw-thread
nearly the whole length
of each, leaving about
two inches to each. At
this end of each get him
to turn a ring, and get
him to close these two
rings into one of the screw-eyes. Get him to make a screw-nut for each
wire about the size of a farthing, but about twice the thickness. Screw the
eye carrying these wires through the tube into the eyepiece block, screw the
remaining two screw-eyes into two of the legs of the stand, on the outside of each
leg and about one foot from the top of each. Bend the cut part of the brass plates
into rings and close them in these screw-eyes. Now put the screw-nuts in their
places in the brass plates, and put the screw wires through the holes in the top, and
turn the nuts to the left, which will draw down the wires and with them the eyepiece
of the telescope. To turn the telescope to the left turn the right-hand nut
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
the right, and the other to the left, and to turn it to the right reverse the action of
the nuts. In making this telescope you must be very careful in fixing the lenses.
They are to be placed so that the centres are to be in one straight line, which line
is to be at right angles to the lenses. You can cover your tube with coloured
paper to give it a finish. It will be advantageous, in using the instrument, by
keeping out all light not wanted, to make a cardboard tube about six inches long
and large enough to slide easily on the end over the object-glass and to project
about five inches. The telescope is now finished, and will with ordinary care last
for years.</p>

<p>It may be well to add that astronomical telescopes show the image inverted;
this is done to save the use of erecting glasses which absorb light, and consequently
make the image faint. If you wish to make yours useful for terrestrial purposes,
you must insert in front of the field lens, and about four inches from it, a lens of
the same focal length; this will turn the image right way up. The blurring of the
image is sometimes caused by the two lenses composing the eye-piece <i>not</i> being at
the distance apart proper for their focal lengths.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XL.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Kaleidoscope, and How to Make it.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">By W. J. Gordon.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">The kaleidoscope is the most successful scientific toy of modern times. Immediately
after its patenting by Sir David Brewster over three hundred thousand were
sold in three months. Essentially it consists of a couple of mirrors arranged at an
angle forming some even sub-multiple of three hundred and sixty. The angle
usually chosen is the sixth, or sixty degrees.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to make a kaleidoscope for home use, it would be well to
try a few experiments with two common pieces of looking-glass. Arrange them as
in the diagram (<a href="#FigXL01">Fig. 1</a>), and placing an object at <span class="smcapall">A</span>, or standing them on a piece of
colour work, notice the beautiful geometrical pattern formed by the various
reflectors. Having experimented with various articles at the angle given, try the
effect at another angle, and note how the slightest change affects the design.</p>

<p>Having grasped the general principle you can proceed to make one of the
commoner varieties of the instrument as usually sold. These have three mirrors.</p>

</div><!--figc600-->

<p>Cut three pieces of common glass into the shape here given. Let them
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
seven and a half inches long, one inch and five-eighths wide at <span class="smcapall">A</span>, and one inch wide
at <span class="smcapall">B</span> (<a href="#FigXL02">Fig. 2</a>). If they are silvered on the back so much the better; if they are not,
paint them black on one side. A very good black paint for the purpose is made
by mixing vegetable black with gold size until it is as thick as cream. Seven-pennyworth
of gold size and a pennyworth of vegetable black, obtained from the
nearest oil-shop, will give you enough paint for a dozen kaleidoscopes, and be
useful for other purposes into the bargain. The three mirrors are to be arranged
in a tube, with their blackened sides outwards (see <a href="#FigXL03">Fig. 3</a>); and the tube is to be
made accordingly. An old copy-book cover can be rolled into the shape, or a
well-pasted strip of newspaper rolled round and round on a stick, as described in
the chapter on the telescope, will give the tube with very little trouble. To fit the
mirrors we have cut the tube should be eight and a quarter inches long, two inches
in diameter at the broad end, and one inch and an eighth in diameter at the
narrow. Of course the tube is not absolutely necessary; a square box two inches
wide and eight inches and a quarter long will answer every purpose, but then the
mirrors, instead of being kept in position by the sides of the case, will have to be
wedged up by pieces of cork or balls of paper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXL04">
<img src="images/illo386a.png" alt="kaleidoscope" width="120" height="120" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.</p>
</div>

<p>Having made the case, fix an eyepiece of tin or cardboard at one end, so that
a hole a quarter of an inch in diameter comes in the centre of the angle made by
the mirrors. This hole is shown in position
in <a href="#FigXL04">Fig. 4</a>, which represents the top of the
tube or box.</p>

<p>At the other end of the tube a round
piece of clear glass is to be fixed, and if
the box is used a square piece will take its
place. The round can be easily made
from the square by chipping off the
corners. An American glass-cutter, costing
sixpence, can be obtained from most tool-shops,
which will be found very useful in cutting glass for this and many other purposes.
The secret in working wheel glass-cutters of all kinds is to keep the handle
as nearly upright as possible and to bear firmly and equally on all parts of the work.</p>

<p>Having cut the plain glass end and fitted it close up against the broad end of
the mirrors, the next thing is to cut a piece of ground-glass of the same size to fit
over it. This ground-glass may be patterned, as in the kaleidoscopes of commerce.
It is, however, more satisfactory to have it plain. Between the glasses you place
the pieces of broken glass to form the designs.</p>

<p>&#8216;The objects which give the finest outlines by inversion are those which have
a curvilinear form, such as circles, ellipses, looped curves like the figure 8, curves
like the figure 3 and the letter S; spirals and other forms, such as squares, rectangles,
and triangles, may be applied with advantage. Glass, both spun and twisted, and
of all colours and shades of colours, should be formed into the preceding shapes;
and when these are mixed with pieces of flat coloured glass, blue vitriol, native
sulphur, yellow ochre, and differently coloured fluids, enclosed and moving in small
vessels of glass, they will make the finest transparent objects for the kaleidoscope.
When the objects are to be laid upon a mirror plate, fragments of
opaquely-coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
glass should be added to the transparent fragments, along with pieces of brass wire,
of coloured foils, and grains of spelter. In selecting transparent objects, the greatest
care must be taken to reject fragments of opaque glass, and dark colours that do
not transmit much light; and all the pieces of spun glass, or coloured plates, should
be as thin as possible.&#8217;</p>

<p>As far as the harmony of colour is concerned, it may be as well to note that the
deepest red harmonises with an equal mixture of blue and green; that red goes
best with green and blue, the blue being predominant; that orange-red requires a
blue with a good deal of indigo; that orange-yellow wants pure indigo; that light
yellow is best with violet and indigo half and half; that greenish-yellow shows off
best by the side of pale violet; that green goes with a full violet; that greenish-blue
combines with violet and red; blue with orange and red; indigo with orange-yellow;
and violet with green.</p>

<p>Satisfactory effects can, however, be produced with almost anything bright and
shining. The first kaleidoscope we, in the thirst for knowledge, took apart was
found to have for its objects about forty pieces of red, green, blue, and brown
stained glass, smashed up into irregular fragments of about a quarter of an inch in
width and length, and as the shapes were varied and the colours crude, the patterns
at every shake were almost as startling as those produced by a sixpenny catharine-wheel
on the 5th of November.</p>

<p>The ground glass should be fitted into a cap, so as to be removable at pleasure,
and the fragments of coloured glass to form the patterns should be left free to move
between the glasses.</p>

<p>Having made this kaleidoscope, and coaxed it into acting properly, experiments
with other contrivances should be made. Mirrors should be arranged at ninety,
forty-five, and forty-five; at ninety, sixty, and thirty, and other angular combinations.
A lens should be fitted at the end of the tube for magnifying purposes, and
the tube should be attached to a magic lantern, and the patterns, almost equalling
the chromatrope, thrown on the screen.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXL05">
<img src="images/illo386b.jpg" alt="kaleidoscope" width="300" height="256" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 5.</p>
</div>

<p>Having worked the fixed mirrors to the point of weariness, shifting mirrors
should be tried, and then two mirrors, made to alter their angles by an arrangement
of screws (see <a href="#FigXL05">Fig. 5</a>), as in the adjustable form of the instrument, should
be experimented with.</p>

<p>You will soon find that when the inclination of the mirrors is not an aliquot
part of 360 the reflections will not join, and then the following table from Sir David
Brewster&#8217;s manual of the kaleidoscope may prove useful<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLI.&mdash;HOW TO MAKE A PORTABLE STAGE AND
FIGURES FOR THE LIVING MARIONETTES.<br />
<span class="smcap">By F. Chasemore.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">These funny little people when well managed will afford great amusement at
holiday and Christmas-tide gatherings. To see these little ladies and gentlemen
dancing and singing and even lecturing on the miniature stage is very laughable,
especially as they are only eighteen inches high. The following hints will enable
any lad to make the figures, as well as a portable stage, for this entertainment.</p>

</div>

</div><!--figc560-->

<p>For the stage you must get some deal strips 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches square, and cut into four
lengths 3 feet 6 inches long for the front and back cross-pieces; four 3 feet long
for the uprights; and four 2 feet 6 inches long. These are to be fitted together
with a mortise and tenon at each end of the cross-pieces, as in <a href="#FigXLI02">Fig. 2</a>. The
uprights are to have plain ends, with a screw-hole in each end. A screw-hole is to
be made right through each corner of the top and bottom frames to screw them to
the uprights by. <a href="#FigXLI03">Fig. 3</a> will show how the corners are fitted, in which <span class="smcapall">A</span> is the
upright, <span class="smcapall">B</span> is the top front cross-piece,
and <span class="smcapall">C</span> is one end cross-piece. The stage is
formed of some half-inch board cut long enough to rest on the back and front
bottom cross-pieces, as seen in <a href="#FigXLI01">Fig. 1</a>, which is a view of the stage when finished
and ready for use. You may, if you would like it more ornamental, put on a cardboard
proscenium, but it would be in the way of portability, as when removed
to take the stage to pieces it would get broken. The top, ends, and back are
closed in with curtains, each curtain fastened by hooks to the cross-pieces, so that
they can be taken off for packing purposes. The back curtain is to be long enough
to hang down about one foot below the stage, and is to be put on very full, with
numerous pleats. In the middle of this back curtain, cut a vertical slit about one
foot long and about nine or ten inches above the stage, and round this slit stitch
some elastic cord. This slit can be seen in <a href="#FigXLI01">Fig. 1</a>. The front of the stage is closed
with two curtains which meet in the middle, and can be drawn up to exhibit the
figures. <a href="#FigXLI04">Fig. 4</a> is a back view of these curtains, with a part of the upper frame to
show how they are drawn up by the cords.</p>

</div><!--figc500-->

<p>The curtains are fastened permanently to the inside of the front top cross-piece.
The cords are sewn one on each, at the edges that meet in the middle when the
curtains are down, at a distance down from the top equal to the width of the top
of each (as in <a href="#FigXLI04">Fig. 4</a>). Six small rings are sewn on the inside of each curtain in a
diagonal direction to the top corner, and the cords are threaded through these rings.
On the inside of the cross-piece and at each end and in the middle are screwed
small picture-rings (as seen in the <a href="#FigXLI04">figure</a>); and underneath the back cross-piece at
the left-hand corner is screwed another picture-ring. The cord of the left-hand
curtain is passed through the left-hand ring; the right cord is passed through the
right-hand ring, and led through the middle ring, and then through the left-hand ring
also, and then the two cords are knotted together and passed through the ring in the
back cross-piece. A loop is made in the end of the cord to pull the curtains up by.
At the bottom of the left-hand back upright a brass hook or screw is screwed in to
hook the loop on to, to keep the curtains up. Now the stage is finished and ready
for the figures. The curtains at back and sides must be of some dark material.
The figures must be about twelve inches high without the head, and must be made
headless. The body and limbs must be made of some light material, and yet solid.
Virgin cork is a very good material to make them of, and is easily worked. <a href="#FigXLI05">Fig. 5</a>
will show you how the body and limbs are made. The arms have no joint at
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
elbow; the legs are jointed at the knees. The arms and thighs are hung to the body
by tapes, and the knee-joints are also made of tape. All these joints must be very
loose and free. The upper end of each arm and the upper ends of the thighs must
have a hole bored into them about two inches deep (as
shown by the dotted lines in <a href="#FigXLI05">Figs. 5</a> and <a href="#FigXLI06">6</a>). The
fore-fingers of your hands are to be inserted in these
holes through the curtain at the back, and through
holes in the clothes of the figures left for that purpose,
and by moving your fingers you can make the figures
gesticulate or dance at pleasure. <a href="#FigXLI07">Fig. 7</a> will show
you how this is managed. <a href="#FigXLI06">Fig. 6</a> is a back view of
the body and a side view of the limbs. The body
has a recess cut in the upper part of the back (as
in <a href="#FigXLI06">Fig. 6</a>). This is to allow of your neck fitting
into it to let your head take the place of the head of
the figure. The shoulders of the body are worked
out to project a little over the arms, and the lower
part of the body is cut away (as in <a href="#FigXLI06">Fig. 6</a>) to allow
of the legs fitting in their places. The hands can
be made closed or open, but a good plan is to have
the right hand closed and a hole bored through it
(as in <a href="#FigXLI06">Fig. 6</a>), when a stick can be placed in it.
The body and limbs should be carved carefully, and
to as good a shape as your anatomical knowledge
will allow. The figures must be dressed in fancy
costume&mdash;in coat, waistcoat, breeches, stockings,
shoes, etc. The female figures must be dressed in
light materials. In all the figures the clothes are
fastened up the back, and the collar of the coat and the necktie are prolonged
into a band to fasten round your neck with a button (as seen in <a href="#FigXLI07">Fig. 7</a>). You
must make this part of the dress very carefully, so as to disguise as much as
possible the junction of the real with the artificial figure. This will be aided by
the curtain at the back being very full, as the folds will hang closely round your
neck. You must paint your face to suit the character of the figure, and put on
fancy hats, also in character.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLI07">

<p class="caption">Fig. 7.</p>
</div>

<p>To use the stage and figures. First put your frame together and screw it
securely. Then put on your curtains and put in the stage-boards, which need not
be fastened. Thread the cords through the rings, and see if they work properly.
When all is right, place the stage on a table with the back towards you, and flush
with the back edge of the table, and hang a tablecloth over the table, hanging to
the ground at the front and sides to hide your legs. Place your figures on the
ground underneath the table, and have a chair to sit down on behind the stage.
Now choose your first figure, make your face up, put on a suitable hat, and hang
the figure round your neck, as in <a href="#FigXLI07">Fig. 7</a>. Now push the figure and your head
through the slit in the back curtain, and your fingers in the holes in the legs and
arms; and, while some one is playing a lively air on the piano, pull the curtain
up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
and commence your performance. If you can have help in pulling the curtain, do
so, as it will leave your hands free. The legs can be worked with one hand, but
the arms must have one hand each; but while the figure is gesticulating his legs
will be still, so that you will have both hands at liberty. And if you use your left
hand for the legs (using the two first fingers, one to each leg), you will be able to
make the figures move one arm at the same time it is dancing. Of course you will
have to learn one or two songs to suit the characters of the figures. You need not
have more than two figures, as, if you have an assistant he can be changing the
clothes of one while you are exhibiting another.</p>

<p>With this stage and figures, a lad with a good voice and plenty of comicality
will be able to give from half to an hour&#8217;s entertainment. When the performance
is over, take the stage to pieces and pack it up, rolling it up in the curtains. It
will go into a very small compass.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLII.&mdash;HOW TO MAKE A PANTAGRAPH.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Take four flat sticks&mdash;size or material does not matter, but for an example let them
be of deal&mdash;eighteen inches long, half an inch wide, and a quarter of an inch thick,
and plane them up true and smooth. At an inch from the end of each stick make
a dot, and divide the sixteen inches between the dots into inches, half inches, etc.,
as if the sticks were measuring rules.
Using the dots as centres, bore in each
stick a round hole just large enough to
hold a piece of brass or other tubing
whose internal diameter is that of a pocket
pencil. Into one end of each stick fit a
section of the tube, opening the edge as in
eyeleting to prevent the quarter-inch ring
so made from slipping out. Take a pair
of the sticks, and hinge them together at
the ends which have not been so treated
with a piece of the tube&mdash;it will be about
half an inch deep&mdash;eyeleting as before.
Hinge the other pair together in the same
way.</p>

<p>Now take a half-inch block of wood of
any shape you please, but not more than
two inches across; bevel it round its upper
edge, and through its centre from the back drive an inch screw whose threaded
part will just fit into the holes in the sticks. Screw it in till the head is flush
with the bottom of the block. You now want a tracer or stile, for which take a
similar screw, and cut off its head by filing the smooth part down to a gently
tapering point. Slip the screw into the hinge of one of the couples, and keep it
in its place by a leather washer above and below, making the distance between the
under side of the wood and the point exactly that of the thickness of the block.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLII01">
<img src="images/illo391.png" alt="pantagraph" width="350" height="358" />
</div>

<p>Now get half a dozen half-inch round-headed dresser-hooks, and put
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
apparatus together in the way shown in the <a href="#FigXLII01">diagram</a>,
where <span class="smcapall">B</span> and <span class="smcapall">C</span> are the points
at which your sticks are hinged. Slip one of the legs over the block <span class="smcapall">F</span>, and screw
it down so that it will move freely but firmly with a leather washer. Place the leg
(<span class="smcapall">C D</span>) under <span class="smcapall">F B</span>,
and screw it into position from the upper surface with one of the
dresser-hooks. Place the leg (<span class="smcapall">C E</span>) over
<span class="smcapall">A B</span>, and screw that into place with another
hook, also from above. The third hook is beneath the apparatus just close to <span class="smcapall">B</span>,
the fourth beneath just close to <span class="smcapall">A</span>, and the fifth and sixth are used to screw the
block on to the drawing-board, and are put in on the bevel, so that their heads will
not project above the surface of the block. The tracer is screwed point downwards
at <span class="smcapall">C</span>, the pencil is at <span class="smcapall">A</span>;
and pencil-tracer, block, and hooks at <span class="smcapall">A</span> and <span class="smcapall">B</span> are all of
equal length, so that the machine moves smoothly and evenly over the flat surface
of your drawing-board.</p>

<p>Now place a map beneath the tracer, and a plain sheet of paper beneath the
pencil. Hold the tracer with the right hand, the pencil with the left, and carefully
guide the tracer over the outline of your map. Let the pencil move about as it
pleases, and you will find that whatever the tracer does the pencil will mimic.
The pencil will gradually draw a copy of the map, but it will move twice as fast as
the tracer, and make its copy twice the size of the original. This is the result of
the way we have at present arranged our pantagraph. The principle is that the
copy compared with the original is always in the same proportion as the distance
from the block to the pencil bears to that from the block to the tracer. Here the
distance in a straight line from <span class="smcapall">F</span> to <span class="smcapall">A</span>
is double that from <span class="smcapall">F</span> to <span class="smcapall">C</span>, hence the copy is
double the size. The position of the tracer between the pencil and the block
depends on the points in the sticks at which they are screwed together, and these
you can vary to suit any scale you desire, remembering always that your figure
(<span class="smcapall">C G B H</span>) must have its opposite sides equal&mdash;that
is to say, <span class="smcapall">C H</span> must always equal
<span class="smcapall">G B</span>, and <span class="smcapall">C G</span> must always equal <span class="smcapall">B H</span>.</p>

<p>To enlarge your map, the distance from <span class="smcapall">F</span>
to <span class="smcapall">C</span> must be less than from <span class="smcapall">F</span> to <span class="smcapall">A</span>;
to reduce your map the distance must somehow be greater. Hence you have only
to transpose your pencil and tracer, putting the pencil at
<span class="smcapall">C</span> and the tracer at <span class="smcapall">A</span>. To
reverse the map, and keep it of the same size, put the block at <span class="smcapall">C</span> and the tracer at
<span class="smcapall">F</span>. In short, by shifting about the pencil, block, and tracer in the different holes
you will soon understand the curious properties of your new copying-machine.
One thing do not forget, and that is that when you shift your pencil the hook which
is put close by to steady its pressure on the paper should be moved with it.</p>

<p>The pantagraph, or pantograph, was invented by Christopher Scheiner two
hundred and eighty years ago; and, carefully made of brass, is in many forms now
used in architects&#8217; and other offices where much drawing and copying are done. If
not made quite truly its lines may be shaky, but it will be found invaluable for the
accurate placing of points, to which lines can be afterwards filled in.</p>

<p>The pattern we have given is easy to make. The instrument may be of different
dimensions and of different materials. It may be fitted together in a different
manner, but it must have its central figure with the opposite sides equal.</p>

<p>Our mathematical friends will soon be able to demonstrate the reason of its
action, and it may be no little satisfaction to the bulk of our readers to find that
there is some practical use in old Euclid after all!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIII.&mdash;MY FLAGSTAFF, AND HOW I RIGGED IT.</h3>

<p class="noindent">There are many forms of flagstaffs, and many ways of erecting and rigging them.
They are sometimes made of iron, and are not unfrequently rigged with wire or
with wire rope. Some are fitted with topmasts, yards, and gaffs, others simply
consist of the one pole.</p>

<p>The flagstaff we are going to describe is not one that will run our readers into
any unnecessary expense. It can be erected, fitted, and rigged by any ordinary
boy of average ability, at a small expense, although of course the more money that
is laid out upon it the better it should look when erected.</p>

<p>We shall give the description, however, of the very cheapest that can be made
consistently with safety. To commence with, the staff itself can be obtained from
any builder by purchasing a small scaffold pole, which will cost&mdash;according to your
skill in bargaining&mdash;from one penny to three halfpence a foot. This can either be
planed and varnished; or, if our reader is not much of a carpenter, it may be
painted white with paint obtained already mixed from the nearest oilshop at about
sixpence a pound.</p>

<p>The height we must leave to the taste of the reader, but the following scale will
be found convenient, and will look very well. Let the pole be 46 feet in length.
Then a hole will have to be dug in the ground 6 feet in depth to receive that
amount of the staff. But before it is erected it must be rigged and have the &#8216;knees&#8217;
screwed or nailed upon it. A big flagstaff would have &#8216;crosstrees&#8217; like the topmast
of a ship, but it will be more easy and will look less clumsy simply to fix it
with knees. These are pieces of wood which will be described <a href="#Ref20">afterwards</a>, and
which have to be fixed about 30 feet from the ground.</p>

<p>The next thing to arrange is the rigging. For that we shall require three
shrouds on each side and one stay in front, besides signal halliards to hoist and
lower the flag. Two-inch rope will do very well for the shrouds, but 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch would
perhaps be a little safer. Rope is sold by weight, and 2-inch rope may be
purchased at sixpence a pound, a pound of 2-inch rope equalling one fathom,
which is 6 feet. The easiest way of measuring in order to ascertain what length of
rope you will require is as follows. Having obtained your staff, lay it upon the
ground. Then measure off the 6 feet that has to go in the ground and mark it
with a piece of chalk. Now measure the 30 feet and mark the staff where the
knees will be placed. Now measure a straight line at right angles to the lower
chalk mark, where the staff, when erected, will be flush with the ground.</p>

<div class="figc500" id="FigXLIII01">
<img src="images/illo394a.png" alt="" width="500" height="177" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
<p class="capjust"><i>a</i>, Six feet for insertion in ground. <i>b</i>, Thirty feet between ground and the

for insertion in ground. <i>f</i>, Chalk mark on ground ten feet from staff. <i>g</i>, Straight
line. <i>h</i>, Length of one shroud or of the stay.</p>
</div>

<p>A good distance is about one-third the height of the staff from the ground to the
knees, so we will say 10 feet, and mark the ground. Then stretch a piece of
string from the upper mark to the mark on the ground, allowing also the circumference
of the staff, that will give you the length of one shroud (<a href="#FigXLIII01">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p>Now you must measure for the ratlines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>Having obtained your rope, the next operation is to cut it into proper lengths.
First of all make both ends fast, and stretch it as much as you can. Then measure
with the line you used to obtain the length, and cut off two shrouds separately, and
the stay. Then cut the
remaining rope in half, so
as to make two pairs of
shrouds. The stay is
generally of thicker and
stronger rope than the
shrouds, but with the staff
6 feet in the ground there
is no necessity for this.</p>

<div class="figc350" id="FigXLIII02">
<img src="images/illo394b.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="430" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig 2</span></p>
<p class="capjust">A, Pair of shrouds. <i>a</i>, The collar to go over the
staff. <i>b</i>, The seizing. B, The single shrouds. <i>a</i>, The
cut splice. C, The stay. <i>a</i>, The eye-splice.</p>
</div>

<p>Now comes the fitting
of the rigging. With the
two single shrouds you
must make a cut-splice, making the splice sufficiently large to fit nicely over the
staff. Then double the two pairs and seize them together separately, A, <a href="#FigXLIII02">Fig. 2</a>,
leaving sufficient room to pass over the
staff without chafing.</p>

<p>The stay you must fit with an eye-splice;
and make the eye large enough, or it will
look lubberly. (<a href="#FigXLIII02">Fig. 2</a>)</p>

<p id="Ref20">The eye and collars should be wormed,
parcelled, and served, but this is not absolutely
necessary, and might look clumsy
if done by an amateur. Now screw on the
knees; they are triangular pieces of wood to
support the rigging and prevent it slipping down the staff. Two bolters, or rounded
pieces of wood, will answer the purpose equally well, but they must be firmly
attached to the staff. Now put on the rigging&mdash;first of all one pair of
shrouds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
next the other pair, then the single shrouds with the cut splice, and lastly the
stay.</p>

<p>The truck must now be placed on the top of the staff. If one is purchased a
sheave will be found in it for the signal halliards to
reeve through, and these had better be rove at once.</p>

<div class="figc200" id="FigXLIII03">
<img src="images/illo394c.png" alt="" width="200" height="324" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig 3</span></p>
<p class="capjust">A, Iron spike. B, Cleats, <i>a</i>, wooden. <i>b</i>, iron.</p>
</div>

<p>If the reader&#8217;s taste runs in such a direction, a vane
to show the direction of the wind can be placed on
the truck&mdash;such as an arrow, a cock, or any of the
numerous articles that are sold for the purpose. A
cleat (<a href="#FigXLIII03">Fig. 3</a>) should be screwed to the side of the
staff just within easy reach of the arm, say between 3
and 4 feet from the ground, in order to belay or make
fast the halliards.</p>

<p>Now fix the staff in the ground, and see that the
earth, etc., is well beaten in round it. The next proceeding
is to set up the rigging. This may be done
with deadeyes or with thimbles; the latter is certainly
the neater way of doing it. Setting up with deadeyes
need not be described here. The following is the
method of doing it with thimbles.</p>

<p>Splice the end of each rope round a thimble, which
is done as follows. Open out the rope to the length
of twice and a half the round of the rope. Then
measure the round of the thimble and the round of the
rope, and put the marlin spike in there and commence
splicing as though for an eyepiece. Now you will
require for each rope an iron spike about 3 feet in
length with an eye in it. These must be driven into
the ground at regular intervals in a straight line, three on each side of the staff,
10 feet distant, and one for the stay in front. Then obtain some stout seizing
stuff, such as cod-line, and splice it into the eye of the spike; then pass it
through the thimble and then through the eye again, and so on, pulling it as tight
as you can every time. At sea the necessary strength for getting the rigging as
tight as possible is obtained with a tackle.</p>

<div class="figc250" id="FigXLIII04">

<p class="caption"><i>a</i> <i>a</i> <i>a</i>, Shrouds. <i>b</i>, Stay.</p>
</div>

<p>Now your staff ought to look like <a href="#FigXLIII04">Fig. 4</a>, and you can commence ratling it
down, for which half-inch rope ought to be used.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIV.&mdash;HOW TO MAKE A POCKET COMPASS AND
TIMEPIECE.<br />
<span class="smcap">By F. Chasemore.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">For this, get a wooden tooth-powder box, plain&mdash;that is, without projecting rims&mdash;take
off the lid, and smooth it all over. Next make the compass-card. Cut this
circular, about a quarter of an inch smaller than the inside of the box, which should
be about two inches and three-quarters in diameter outside. Mark the centre of
the card, and mark from this centre the thirty-two points of the compass (as <a href="#FigXLIV01">Fig. 1</a>).
Now make the needle. This must be hard steel; you can get this at the tinman&#8217;s
or ironmonger&#8217;s. Get him to cut it about two inches long and three-eighths of an
inch wide in the middle, tapering to a point at each end. The steel should be
about a sixteenth of an inch thick. Get him to drill a hole through the middle of
this steel about an eighth of an inch in diameter. Get a small piece of brass wire
a quarter of an inch in diameter and a quarter of an inch long. File a shoulder to
this (as <a href="#FigXLIV02">Fig. 2</a>) about a sixteenth of an inch wide and an eighth of an inch from
the end. Drill a hole triangular in section an eighth of an inch deep and about an
eighth of an inch at the outside. Place this through the compass-card. Now
magnetize your needle. This is done as follows.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLIV01">
<img src="images/illo396a.png" alt="compass" width="400" height="399" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLIV02">
<img src="images/illo396b.jpg" alt="compass" width="200" height="87" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLIV03">
<img src="images/illo396c.jpg" alt="compass" width="400" height="212" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>Get a magnet&mdash;most boys have one&mdash;and draw one end of it from end to end
of the needle, always going the same way and never back again. Do this about
twenty times and your steel needle will be a permanent magnet. Now place this
underneath the compass-card and push the little brass button through the hole in
it. Suspend this by placing a point in the hole in the brass stud, and one end of
the needle will point towards the north. Mark this point, and turn the card on the
stud till that end of the needle points to eighteen and a half degrees west of the
north point on the card. Now fasten the brass in the needle by two or three
taps with a hammer on the under side of the brass, being careful not to strike
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
steel. Next fix it more securely with a dot of sealing-wax on each point and card.
Now suspend it again on the point, and the north point will dip towards the
earth. You must balance the card by putting dots of sealing-wax here and there
till it swings quite level.</p>

<p>Next, in the centre of the bottom of your box fix a steel pin about half an inch
high, brought to a point that will go loosely in the dent in the brass stud. Put
your card on this point and it will swing easily in the box. Line the box with a
strip of cardboard a little wider than the height of the top of the brass stud from
the bottom of the box. Get a circular glass the size of the inside of the box (your
glazier will cut this for you for a few pence). Put it on the shelf formed by the
cardboard, which should be glued into the box, and fasten it in its place with a
narrow strip of cardboard glued in all round the box.</p>

<p>By putting the glass in you can turn the box about any way in your pocket
without the card coming off the peg.</p>

<p>Now to make the timepiece. Make a dial plate of paper the size of the top of
the lid. You can first draw this on a sheet of paper, and then placing one leg of
a pair of compasses on a point in the twelve-o&#8217;clock line&mdash;which must in this case
be only one line, about half an inch from the six-o&#8217;clock line&mdash;mark a circle the
exact size of the top of the lid. Inside this circle make another about a quarter
of an inch from it, and mark the hours inside this circle. Paste this paper on
the top of the lid, and put the lid on the box.
Now draw a line from the twelve-o&#8217;clock line
on the lid right down the side of the box;
make this line quite perpendicular to the top
and bottom. Now make the gnomon. Get a
piece of very thin sheet brass or tin-plate
about the thickness of a card and cut the
gnomon out of it. The shape and size can be
got from directions already given. Now with
a thin, fine saw, cut the twelve-o&#8217;clock line
into a slot about a sixteenth of an inch deep
and going beyond the six-o&#8217;clock line a little,
about an eighth of an inch. This slot must be the same depth in the six-o&#8217;clock
end as at the edge of the lid. You can push the base of the gnomon into this slot,
so that the axis edge exactly crosses the six-o&#8217;clock line.</p>

<p>To use the compass, take off the lid, place the box level, and note where the
north points, and you can determine any point of the compass from that. To use
the timepiece, set the box level, and bring the mark in the side of the box to
correspond exactly with the north point of the card. Put the gnomon in the slot
in the lid, and put the lid on the box without disturbing it, so that the mark in the
side of the lid corresponds exactly with the mark in the side of the box, and the
shadow of the axis of the gnomon will point out the hour. When you have seen
the time, take off the lid, take the gnomon out of the slot, and put it inside the box,
laying on the glass, and put the lid on. You can thus carry the whole in your
pocket without a fear of it getting out of order; and when you are out for a walk,
and the sun shines, you can always tell your way home and the time to go there.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLV.&mdash;WOOD-WORKING AND CARVING; OR, WALKING-STICKS
AND HOW TO TREAT THEM.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Walking-sticks of all varieties&mdash;apple, ash, blackthorn, brier, cherry, elm, hazel,
holly, oak, vine, and whitethorn&mdash;are best when cut in the winter, between
November and February; the sap is then sluggish, the leaves are off, and the
character of the stick can be most easily descried.</p>

<p>To boys who desire to carry a stick of their own choice and dressing, the
following practical notes will be of value.</p>

<p>Never attempt to trim a stick as soon as you have cut it. Leave the branches
on it an inch or two long, and hang the stick up to dry for a week or so, knob end
uppermost with a weight on the narrow end. Let it hang in a moderately cool
place, and when it is dry and pliable, take it down and begin to trim it. Cut off
the branches you do not want, and make the crook if you do not care to finish
merely with a knob. To make the crook, plunge the end for a quarter of an hour
in boiling water, bend it to shape, and keep it in place by a piece of string twisted
by a stick in the middle, like the spring of a jumping frog, or the stretcher of a
ribbon saw. When the stick has dried in shape, trim it to taste with a sharp knife,
and give it a good rub down with sand-paper. When it is smooth and presentable,
if you want it to remain its natural colour, give it a coat of boiled linseed-oil, and
let this dry thoroughly into it. If you want the stick to be black, boil a pound of
logwood chips for an hour in a quart of water, and brush the stick over with the
boiling liquor. When the stick is dry, give it another boiling coat of the decoction.
When that is dry, dissolve an ounce of green copperas in a quart of hot water and
coat the stick with the solution. Keep the stick away from the fire, and let
it dry each time slowly and well, and you will find that the mixture of the copperas
and the logwood has dyed it an intense black. After you have stained it, give it a
coat of boiled oil, and when that is thoroughly dry, begin to polish it.</p>

<p>For the polish, mix an ounce and a half of shellac with a quarter of an ounce of
gum mastic, and dissolve them slowly in half a pint of methylated spirits, or, what
is better, quicker, and cheaper, buy threepenny worth of French polish from the
nearest oil-shop.</p>

<p>Having polished the stick, finish it with a coat of hard varnish or copal varnish
such as the artists use, of which a little goes a long way. Hard varnish can be
bought cheaply. If you must make it, mix together an ounce of gum mastic, two
ounces of gum juniper, a quarter of an ounce of turpentine, and a pint of
methylated spirits. Give the stick one or two even coats of varnish, and you will
find it last for many months. Some sticks do very well varnished over the oil and
stain, then the polish is saved. If you want to stain a stick brown, add dragon&#8217;s
blood to the polish; if you like it golden coloured, drop in some yellow ochre or
gamboge. The difficulty in stick-making, however, is not in the polishing; it is in
the bending and trimming.</p>

<p>Apple makes excellent sticks if judiciously dried. Ash sticks are best cut from
saplings; when cut from hedges or pollards, they are inclined to become
brittle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
Like apple sticks, they require careful seasoning to be serviceable. Blackthorn
sticks are heavy, and liable to splinter. They are best when cut from saplings.
Brier sticks are also best when cut from saplings. Cherry sticks should be stripped
of only a part of their bark, and require sand-papering, oiling, polishing, and
varnishing. Elm sticks should have the rough bark left on; they also are best
when taken from saplings, but it is very seldom indeed that an elm stick is fit for
anything else than to be looked at. Hazel sticks are light and handsome, and do
good service, no matter whence they are cut. They should be well rubbed down
with sandpaper and carefully varnished. Holly sticks are as good as any. Cut
them from the branch with the crook or knob attached, and let them have a long
time to dry. Oak sticks are the strongest and toughest, but the most difficult to
dry and trim. If you dry them too rapidly they split, if you dry them with the
bark off they split, if you have the knots close together they split. If you get a good
oak cudgel you can smash any stick of any other wood not exceeding it in
size.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
Vine sticks are also of value, but they have an unpleasant tendency to warp and twist.
Whitethorn sticks are like unto blackthorn sticks&mdash;heavy, treacherous, and brittle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLV01">
<img src="images/illo399.jpg" alt="sticks" width="500" height="422" />
</div>

<p>If you want to bark a stick, steep it in hot water, and rub off the coat with a
piece of sacking. If you want to bend or straighten a stick, cover it with hot wet
sand, and get it into shape while it is hot.</p>

<p>Of canes we need make no mention, nor need we deal with the birch. They
are but luxuries, frequently doomed to be misunderstood. Their days are over.
Alas, poor cane! Alas, poor birch!</p>

<p>Nothing has been said so far about carving its handle, and as a stick of our own
cutting and carving has a certain charm about it, and in its making affords an
agreeable exercise for a wet day, we <a href="#FigXLV01">herewith</a> give a couple of designs which can
easily be improved upon, and which are grotesque enough to look well even as
failures; and this to a beginner is a quality not to be despised. We may as well,
however, adopt the usual plan of descending from generals to particulars, and find
space for a few notes on stick history.</p>

<p>When &#338;dipus solved the riddle of the Sphinx, he thought of a walking-stick&mdash;as
many others of the puzzled have done. &#8216;There&#8217;s a being,&#8217; said the riddler,
&#8216;which has four feet, and three feet, with only one voice; but its feet vary, and
when it has the most it is the weakest.&#8217; &#8216;That,&#8217; said &#338;dipus, &#8216;must be man,
who, when he is a child, crawls on his hands and knees; when he is a man walks
uprightly; and when he is old totters with a walking-stick!&#8217;</p>

<p>On the origin and development of the walking-stick a goodly volume might be
written. Perhaps the most interesting form the stick took was that of the pilgrim&#8217;s
staff. This staff was about four feet long, armed at the lower end with a spike, and
fitted about a foot from its top with a knob for the hand to rest upon. The lower
part was solid, the upper part was hollow, and was used for relics of saints, or a
musical instrument, or something to eat, according to the taste of the owner. It
was in a pilgrim&#8217;s staff that saffron was secretly brought from Greece to Saffron
Walden, and it was in a similar way that silkworms found their way to Europe.
This idea of using a stick as a carrier has been utilised in our own days, not only
for telescopes, match-boxes, swords, and guns, but also for surgeons&#8217; instruments.</p>

<p>Another striking form was that of the ferula, which derives its name from the
giant fennel, of whose stalk it generally consisted. The tough lightness of the
fennel wood rendered it particularly suited for the support of the aged, and hence
it gradually became the prototype of those lighter wands which have continued
amongst us as a sign of office or seniority; and at the same time it retained its
popularity with the chastisers of erratic youth. In the East the ferula was replaced
by the reed; but in Egypt the reed gave place to slender sticks of cherry wood, some
of which had a carved handle. This carving of the head is, however, peculiar to no
country and no age. It is a practice indulged in by all men, savage and civilised.</p>

<p>In our own Tudor period the walking-stick began to flourish much. Then for
the first time do we get it elaborately carved and adorned with precious metals.
In the inventory of the old palace at Greenwich, there is entered, &#8220;A cane
garnished with sylver and gilte, with astronomie upon it. A cane garnished with
golde, having a perfume on the toppe; under that a diall with a pair of twitchers
and a pair of compasses of golde; and a foot rule of golde, a knife and a file
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
golde, with a whetstone tipped with golde.&#8221; A somewhat elaborate battery to
carry in a walking stick! In the seventeenth century sticks became even more
ornamental, and in the eighteenth they began to be made entirely of agate, or
clouded marble, or ivory. How these were used and abused can be learnt from
No. 103 of the <i>Tattler</i>, where Isaac Bickerstaffe issues licences regarding them,
and is appealed to by petitioners, one of whom asks for permission to retain his
cane on account of its having become as indispensable to him as any of his
other limbs. &#8220;The knocking of it upon his shoe, leaning one leg upon it, or
whistling upon it with his mouth, are such great reliefs to him in conversation, that
he does not know how he should be good company without it.&#8221; Later on this fashion
of elaborate walking sticks was adopted by the old ladies, and it was quite common
to see the dames out walking with wood, ivory, whalebone, or green glass sticks,
five or six feet in length, having the ends bent over like a shepherd&#8217;s crook, and
twisted back again towards the ground.</p>

<p>In these days, now that the means of communication have been so much
improved and the world become one huge country, foreign sticks have lost much of
their rarity. They come to us in tons, and a stick importer&#8217;s warehouse is a sight
to see. The goods in the rough do not look inviting; in fact, anything more
resembling a lot of firewood it would be difficult to imagine. Those who have not
the chance of seeing the interior of one of these stores, can obtain a very good
notion of what they are like by inspecting a shop window next door to the Autotype
Gallery in what used to be New Oxford Street. There can be seen canes of all
sorts, rough and rooty, from the eastern and western tropics&mdash;rajahs from Borneo;
malaccas from Sumatra (nearly all the malaccas come from Siak, they are the stems
of <i>Calamus scipionum</i>); whanghees (the stems of <i>Phyllostachis</i>) from Hongkong;
lawyers (a species of <i>Calamus</i>) from Penang; ratans and dragons from Calcutta;
white bamboos, black bamboos, fluted bamboos from other seaports in the great
Bay of Bengal; partridge canes, jambees, and dog&#8217;s-head canes; Spanish reeds
(<i>Arundo donax</i>); jacks (vine stems), cinnamons, pimentos (the stem of the allspice),
cabbage-stalks, and coffee-branches from the West Indies, with the green-backed
orange and knobby lemon sticks from the same colonies; triangular leaf stalks of
the date palm from Tunis; myrtle, pomegranate, and olive sticks from Algeria and
Italy; blue gums from Australia; mahoganies from Cuba; ebonies, tulips, and
crocodiles; cabbage-stalks from Guernsey; and, perhaps, tooroos from Guiana.</p>

<p>But English sticks, and the foreign importations supposed to be such, are the
favourites after all, and it is them that we would ask our readers to choose for their
experiments. The chief, as already explained, are oak, ash, beech, blackthorn,
cherry, maple, crab, and hazel, all of them within reach of those that walk or dwell
in country places, and all easily dressed and made presentable.</p>

<p>The most useful of them are the ash and beech, which can be stained and cut to
resemble any stick, and form the raw material of almost all the shams. A goodly
proportion of the blackthorn sold in the streets are beech sticks carved and dyed.
It is easy to dye a stick black. Brush it over it with a hot decoction of logwood
and nutgalls, and when it is dry give it a brushing with vinegar in which rusty nails
have lain for two or three days. If you wish to dye it red, add some dragon&#8217;s-blood
gum to the polish; if you wish it to be yellow, use ochre instead of dragon&#8217;s blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>All sticks should be cut in the winter and left to dry in the rough in a cool
place. If the bark is to come away let the stick be half dry before you begin to
work upon it. If the bark is to remain on, let the stick get thoroughly dry before
you attempt to trim it.</p>

<p>Ash sticks can be got from the hedge or the thin branches of a pollard, but the
best are young saplings taken up root and all, the root coming in handy for carving.
Oak sticks are easy to carve, but difficult to dry without splitting; they are the
toughest and strongest of all sticks, and are generally got from copse-wood stumps.
Holly sticks are best with the bark off; they are best when cut from the secondary
branches that shoot up parallel to the main trunk. Sometimes they are found as
saplings, and then the roots are retained as groundwork for decoration. Elm sticks
are easily got and easily worked, but seldom turn out satisfactorily. Hazel, on the
contrary, gives first-rate stick wood, and is soft and easily cut, and if tolerably thick
and well dried it will not bend. Blackthorn is the best stick in vogue at what has
taken the place of the historic Donnybrook, but there are many tougher and more
trustworthy weapons for the peculiar recreation in which it is usually employed. It
is an easy stick to prepare and polish, but like case-hardened iron to carve. We
are told that those who attempt its carving generally borrow the tools from some
unsuspecting friend! <i>Verb. sap.</i>, or rather <i>verb.</i> to those who have dried out its <i>sap</i>
and not discovered brittleness. Cherry sticks and apple sticks come easily to hand,
and are not unfrequently charred with a hot iron and stained with acids to enable
them to be sold as foreigners. Birch and poplar are best left alone. British vines
almost always warp; and brier and whitethorn, like all the <i>Rosace&aelig;</i>, have wood that
snaps and splinters on the slightest provocation.</p>

<p>To shape a stick use hot sand or steam, and fix it in the desired position when
hot. To straighten it lash it when hot to a board, or hang it up with a heavy
weight at its end. To dress it or polish it employ one of the methods described in
the former part of this section.</p>

<p>When carving a handle, choose some design that will be smooth to the hand.
As examples try a man&#8217;s head. One of the most extraordinary collections of
walking-sticks ever made was formed by Robertson of Kincraigie, who was popularly
supposed to be &#8216;daft.&#8217; It was his practice to carve on his stick the head of any
friend or foe he met with, and in time he owned quite a portrait gallery of wooden
heads, which proved the cause of much wonderment to his visitors, for every batch
he entertained had their features promptly reproduced in oak or hazel! As suitable
designs for stick-heads there may be instanced dogs&#8217; heads, birds&#8217; heads, particularly
broad-beaked ones, such as goose and albatross, snakes&#8217; heads, fishes, and squirrel
and beaver tails. To get good results proper carving tools should be used, cutting
up instead of down with the grain; but capital work can be done with an ordinary
penknife, the secret of success consisting in never cutting away a chip unless its
removal has been well thought over. Carving stick-heads is not like carving panels,
and fine work is out of the question with regard to them. There is not much room
for improvement in the art. We saw in the 1851 Exhibition a stick carved in
China 4,000 years ago, and it was as well done as anything now obtainable from
the London stick-seller.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVI.&mdash;CAGES AND HUTCHES: AND HOW TO MAKE
THEM.<br />
<span class="smcap">By Gordon Stables, C.M., M.D., R.N.</span></h3>

<h4 class="fsize80">I.&mdash;THE TOOLS AND MATERIALS&mdash;USEFUL HINTS.</h4>

<p class="noindent">Candidly, we must admit, that to attempt in this chapter to give anything like a
complete and elaborate account of the making of the many different kinds of cages
and hutches in which to keep pets of feather or pets of fur would be folly.</p>

<p>But I can give my readers many hints that will be of use to them on the
subject in hand, and I may begin by telling them that it is not half so difficult to
manufacture a good roomy, healthy, wholesome breeding-cage as may at first
appear.</p>

<p>Nor need the cage you make be at all ugly or clumsy; only take pains with it,
and do not be in a hurry, and I feel sure you will succeed. Do not let any person
dishearten you by saying, &#8216;You can buy cheaper than you can make.&#8217; I doubt if
you could do so, but even allowing this were possible, you could not point proudly
to your bought cage and say, &#8216;I made that.&#8217;</p>

<p>Now the first questions of practical moment I have to answer are these:
1, What tools are required in the manufacture of cages? And, 2, What materials?</p>

<p>An answer to the first question will enable you to decide at once whether or
not you think it worth your time and trouble to go in for cage or hutch-making.
I shall mention the tools that it is indispensable you should possess, and you may
either buy them or borrow them, as you please. If you are merely going to make
one cage or two, perhaps you had better borrow them. But I take this opportunity
of reiterating this advice to all sensible boys who may have some spare
time on their hands, to possess themselves of a box of useful tools. Cheap boxes
of tools are <i>worse than want</i>. If you mean getting tools, get good ones. Do not
be caught by the glitter and get-up of the box that contains them, nor by the
sheen of the contents either. Be suspicious of articles that are advertised at an
exceedingly low price, else you may find yourself possessed of hammers whose
heads won&#8217;t stop on, saws as brittle as brass, gimlets and awls that burst their
handles, planes with pot-metal tongues, and pliers as soft as cheese.</p>

<p>It is far better to fit your own box up, and fill it, buying the articles you
require at a respectable ironmonger&#8217;s shop, and paying a fair price for them.
Then all you have to remember is to keep everything in its place, and keep all
steel work free from rust, and the box itself in its own corner and locked, so that
Mary Ann, when she wants to break coals, will not have an opportunity of
appropriating your axe.</p>

<p>Talking about rust, I find nothing better wherewith to smear tools that are to
be laid past for a short time than a little blue ointment. You should keep a morsel
of this in a chip box in a handy corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, now, as to birdcage and hutch-making, you must have, first and foremost,
a bench whereon to work. Any old table will do if it be strong enough. But one
thing it must have, and that is a contrivance to hold the wood on which you are
working with the plane or other instrument. This may either be the wooden screw
apparatus, or what is cheaper, the bench-lug.</p>

<p>The tools and things you really want, and must have, to make anything like a
job, are (1) a nice sizeable saw, one that will either rip or cross-cut, so it must not
have a back to it. (If you go in for fine and ornamental work about your cage it will
be better to have a lathe&mdash;cost about &pound;3 10s.&mdash;and a box of fretwork tools which
will run you in to &pound;1 10s. more. So take my advice&mdash;be content with what is
useful for a time. If you breed some beautiful canaries you can sell them, and
having extended the balance at your banker&#8217;s, go in for the ornamental afterwards.)
(2) A plane or two, one plain plane, and one plough. I do not advise a jack. I
know when I was a boy I could not manage the jack-plane nearly so well as the
little short one. (3) Some chisels; say three; they are cheap and useful in a
thousand ways. Mind, always keep them sharp, and do not use the mallet much
on the end of them. (4) A wooden mallet. (5) A hammer or two, with claws at
the end. (6) A spokeshave. (7) Pliers and pincers for ironwork. (8) A boring
brace and bits to fit. (9) A bradawl or two. (10) A small hand-vice. (N.B.&mdash;This
last is most essential for holding your wires, etc. Sometimes this vice itself will
want holding to enable you to work with both hands. Very well, be handy, fasten
it on to the end of your bench by means of the lug or screw apparatus.) (11) A
two-foot rule. Do not buy a cheap one; it goes all out of shape in no time;
besides, if you have a really serviceable article you can use it as a square. (12) A
hone or sharpening stone. (13) Etceteras, in the shape of nails and screws of
various sizes (I myself use nothing but the round French nails; they do not split
the wood; they go home kindly, and with ordinary care they do not bend); a jam-pot
to heat your glue, some glue to heat, a carpenter&#8217;s pencil, sand-paper, and a
small oil-flask. Other little things may suggest themselves to you; I can&#8217;t think of
anything else at present. And I would not mind beginning to make either an
ordinary breeding cage or a hutch at this moment with the tools I have just
named.</p>

<p>But, &#8216;What a lot!&#8217; you will say, and &#8216;what a deal of money they will cost!&#8217;
Yes, but think of the many useful things
you can make with those tools, quite independent
of either cage or hutch.</p>

<p>And now as to the materials. What are
these? I answer in two words, wood and
wire. The wood may be almost any sort,
but it must be very well seasoned, else as
soon as it gets wet you will find the bottom
of your cage coming off, or the back
bulging out, and the whole concern gaping in the most unseemly way. The parts
to be polished and stained may be hard wood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLVI01">
<img src="images/illo404.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="195" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;Simple Breeding Cage.</p>
</div>

<p>The cage I have had <a href="#FigXLVI01">figured</a> is an ordinary two-roomed breeding-cage.
It might have been a trifle easier for you to have tried your &#8216;&#8217;prentice
han&#8217;,&#8217; as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
Burns calls it, on perhaps a show-cage to begin with, but I cannot forget that the
cock canary may have sometimes to be separated for a time from the hen; hence
that partition with the hole in it, a hole that may be closed.</p>

<p>Some cagemen recommend this to be a fixture, but do you not think with me that
if the partition can be withdrawn, so as to make both cages into one big one when
required, it is better?</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">II.&mdash;CANARY BREEDING-CAGES, GERMAN AND ENGLISH.</h4>

<p>I have already said that the wood a cage is made of is a matter of secondary
importance. The body may be pine, for instance, and the front parts any kind of
ordinary hard wood&mdash;mahogany to wit. The cage (<a href="#FigXLVI02">Fig. 2</a>) which is now before
us is one of the German kind, manufactured by Mr. Abrahams, naturalist,
St. George Street East. The nest has, however, been put in the drawing in the
wrong compartment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLVI02">
<img src="images/illo405a.jpg" alt="cage" width="450" height="307" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLVI03">
<img src="images/illo405b.jpg" alt="cage" width="450" height="314" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>In order to make a breeding-cage like this, you repair to your working shop or
garret, and having wood, wires, and tools all handy, you first determine the size you
wish it to be. Well, I am of opinion that birds cannot have too much room;
therefore, for sake of a little more wood and a little more wire, do not begrudge
them space; say, 22 in. long, 11 in. wide, and 14 in. high. You can, I think,
get wood wide enough to have the back all one piece, as well as each side
and the bottom. If you cannot, just use your ingenuity, and make a neat
job of joining.</p>

<p>Measure and cut the wood for the top and bottom first, both exactly the same,
then the sides ditto. Now plane the wood very nicely, leaving it about three-eighths
to half an inch thick. Do the same by the piece of wood that is to
form the back.</p>

<p>No dovetailing is needed, and that is a good thing, is it not? Now cut out
your square doorway in each gable. If you do this neatly the pieces that you have
sawed out or cut out will themselves form the doors. Size of each door&mdash;say four
inches square. This is big enough for any one&#8217;s hand, and big enough to put the
nest in. But never mind fitting the doors at present; we will do that after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>Next proceed to fix the box-work of the cage; that is, fasten sides, back, and
bottom in their positions, and we will then turn our attention to the front and the
internal fittings. There is a hole in the back part, by-the-way, by which you hang
the cage on a nail. You may as well make that before you fix up. Have your
small nails, your hammer, and your glue-pot at hand, the latter hot, because before
you send the nails quite home you must insert a goodly dose of glue. This is
important, because it entirely fills up any crevice that might otherwise harbour
vermin, and if these once get into your breeding-cage your prospects of doing any
good are very likely to be ruined for one season.</p>

<p>Now nail and glue your sides to the back first and foremost, then turn the cage
upside down, and fasten in the same way the bottom to the sides and back, reverse
and do the same to the top. If you have previously taken correct measurements
of the parts, the body of your cage will now look square and fair and neat. If
you have not, you had better take it to pieces again and mend matters before you
go any further.</p>

<p>Direct your attention next to the front, but you had better let the work you
have already done get firm and dry before doing much more to it. Meanwhile
measure and make the piece of hard wood that crosses the cage in front just above
the bottom drawer (<a href="#FigXLVI02">Fig. 2</a>, <span class="smcapall">A</span>).This should be from two to two and a half inches
wide, and an oblong space or opening (<span class="smcapall">B B</span>) is to be left at each end. These are
for the little seed-tins to fit in. As soon as you have made this piece of wood (<span class="smcapall">A</span>)
and dressed it most neatly, you may place it in position. This must be most
carefully done, leaving a full inch of space beneath it for your bottom drawer or
false bottom. Nail it from the sides.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLVI04">
<img src="images/illo406a.jpg" alt="cage" width="450" height="276" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLVI05">
<img src="images/illo406b.jpg" alt="cage" width="450" height="306" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 5.</p>
</div>

<p>You can now proceed to make this false bottom, taking great care that the front
part, which is of hard wood (<a href="#FigXLVI02">Fig. 2</a>, <span class="smcapall">C</span>), fits the space you left for it exactly, and
without a flaw. The mechanism of this false bottom is so simple that instead of
describing it or illustrating it, I beg to refer you to your friend Smith&#8217;s cage. A
glance will suffice. But remember not to spare the glue on that either.</p>

<p>Well, a glance at the complete cage (<a href="#FigXLVI02">Fig. 2</a>) will show you that there is a wire
partition at <span class="smcapall">D</span> dividing the cage into two compartments, a big and a small. This
partition, however, does not go right to the bottom of the cage, because it is a
sliding one and draws out. It runs at top and bottom in grooves made by three
pieces of wood, one of the pieces of the lower groove being deeper than the
others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
and quite filling up the vacancy between the false bottom and the wire partition, so
as to prevent a bird from creeping through under.</p>

<p>This wire partition, then, had better be made next. It is simply a carefully
measured and carefully adjusted square frame, neatly wired in the same way as the
barred front of the cage is wired, of which I shall presently speak. You make the
little frame first, then you bore your holes and wire it, and next you nail and glue a
little front piece of hard wood on to it with a small wire-work handle in the centre,
whereby to pull it out.</p>

<p>The grooves in which this is to run should now be made top and bottom, the
lower one fastened to the cross board (<span class="smcapall">A</span>), and the upper to the back of the cage at
one end and to the front when finished at the other.</p>

<p>Now for the front. This is to be made separately, and then slipped in. There
is another plan, but I think I give the better of the two. Glance again at <a href="#FigXLVI02">Fig. 2</a>. Take
a look at friend Smith&#8217;s cage as well. Now scratch your elbow thoughtfully, gather
all your scattered senses together, and all your brains, and proceed to business.
There is a top bar and a lower bar, and two strong cross wires; but mark this,
please&mdash;these cross wires are not continuous all the way, there must be a space left
for your wire partition to slip out and in.</p>

<p>Well, you have your wires all ready. Measure the length you want them, and
cut them all of a size a little longer than they are actually required. They have
to pass right through the upper bar (<a href="#FigXLVI02">Fig. 2</a>), and be fastened into the lower (<a href="#FigXLVI02">Fig. 2</a>),
and as the same space&mdash;namely, half an inch&mdash;must exist between each wire,
before you bore the holes for them you must carefully mark the places on both
bars, and this is done either with a pair of compasses, or more surely and securely
with the prongs of a two-toed fork. While making or wiring the front, be sure first
that the top and bottom bars are exactly the same length, then lay them fair and square
on your bench or table, and tack them down with small nails: so shall you do your
work firmly and well. Bore the holes very even which you have marked off, then
put each wire through separately and snip off with your pliers what is not wanted.
The wires, by means of your hand-vice, should previously be made as straight as
possible. When you have got all your upright wires in put on your cross pieces.
These are simply laid on over the others and whipped in position with a long thread
of very fine wire.</p>

<p>Now your front is all ready. Of course you have not forgotten the little ring-like
spaces at the bottom, through which the canary pops its head to get a drop of
water from the fountains. These last may be glass, and they are slung in wire
loops from the cross-board.</p>

<p>The perches are easily put in. It is better to have one cross one as well as two
or three from front to back.</p>

<p>When you have your little doors made, and neatly hinged with wire, the greater
part of the work is finished.</p>

<p>The polishing and varnishing, and nest and nest material, I will speak about
presently. The different types of cages shown in <a href="#FigXLVI03">Figs. 3</a> to <a href="#FigXLVI05">5</a> need no verbal
explanation, the pictures speaking for themselves.</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">III.&mdash;NESTS AND NEST-BOXES&mdash;THE GERMAN METHOD OF BREEDING&mdash;HUTCHES
FOR RABBITS, GUINEA-PIGS, RATS, AND SQUIRRELS.</h4>

<p>It will be high time now to return your friend Smith&#8217;s cage, for the probability is
that, as the breeding season will soon commence, he will want it himself. I gave
full directions just now for the completion of your own cage, with one or two little
items excepted. Take a glance before you carry it back, then, at the neat way
small fastenings and hinges are made for the doors, and little handles to pull out
the partition and the false bottom, and the solitary big one on the top for the
purpose of lifting the cage. Very natty and neat, are they not? and all made out
of wirework. Pliers and pincers, and a little handiness on your part, are all that
is wanted, but it is better you should observe how things are done. The wire loops
that hold the glass fountains are fastened in the same way&mdash;holes made, the wire
put through and doubled down behind so that it shall not pull out, and the whole
thing is ready.</p>

<p>Two tiny two-inch square or oval tin drawers to slip in at each corner of the
lower front of the cage are infinitely better to hold seed and food generally, than
those long wooden world-old drawers with holes in them, which make such beautiful
receptacles for dust and vermin.</p>

<p>As to the nests, you have plenty of option. These can be bought. There are
wooden ones to hang up on a nail at the back of the cage, tin ones, basket or rope
ones, and also those which you can make yourself out of half a large cocoanut-shell.
The basket and rope nests, it is said&mdash;I have not tried them and do not
mean to&mdash;do very well if previously steeped in petroleum and dried. The tin and
earthenware nests are neatly lined with soft felt; a bit of an old hat does very well
properly shaped, steeped, and moulded in.</p>

<p>The cocoanut-shell will suit every useful purpose. You can make
it yourself, lining it well with warm lambs&#8217;-wool. Fasten a loop of wire
round the top edge to join in front, and finally extend to form two
hooks to fasten the nest on to the cage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLVI05a">
<img src="images/illo408.jpg" alt="nest" width="200" height="141" />
</div>

<p>When breeding birds, it is as well to have a small nursery cage to put the
fledgelings into. The parent birds then feed them through the bars. Also a bath-cage.
Both these are attached when wanted to the main cage. They are very
simple in construction, and you can easily make them yourself. Any ordinary
small cage will do for the bath, one side being taken out and hooks put on
wherewith to fit it to the side of the cage opposite the doorway. The bath is a tin
or zinc dish inside the cage, but a large saucer or a soup plate will do very well.
Remember, I am not talking now about breeding, but ordinary living cages.</p>

<p>Mr. Abrahams, the well-known naturalist, of 191, George Street East, London, a
visit to whose menagerie would well repay any one fond of birds and beasts, writes
to me in the following strain about canary breeding. I need hardly tell you that I
value his opinions, as they are the result of long experience. He says: &#8216;I do not
hold with the English way of breeding canaries; they will stick to their old style of
a hundred years back. They use cages which may be divided, by means of a
partition, into two compartments. In one of these compartments there are
two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
small boxes, in which the birds are to build their nests. Outside the cage a bag is
fastened containing hair and other building material, which not seldom are
far from cleanly, and often already provided with the eggs and germs of insects
(vermin).</p>

<p>&#8216;It is rarely that the male and female are of the same opinion in which box the
nest should be built. If the hen has begun to build in one box the cock will pull
the nest to pieces, and begin to work in the other box, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Thus not
only is time lost, but the birds are excited and become weak. When at last they
have young ones they are often wretched, timid little things, and often both young
and parents die from being continually worried by insects.</p>

<p>&#8216;Many tens of thousands of canaries are imported annually into England from
the Continent, and of these the Belgian, Dutch, and French canaries especially are
strong, bold-looking fellows, and nothing like our timid little creatures that flutter
about or creep into a corner if anybody comes near the cage. How can this
difference be accounted for? On my many travels in the countries of the
Continent I have watched how canaries are bred there. Almost every working
man breeds canaries in his workshop. On one side of the room he has his bench
or worktable, and round the walls there are cages, parted off by partitions into
smaller compartments of about three feet square. Each of these compartments
can again be divided into two by a movable partition, which consists simply of a
wooden frame covered over with wire. In one compartment the cock is put; in
the other one or more hens; also a tin with seed and another with water. Now the
moment is watched when the cock and hen become friendly, then the partition is
withdrawn, so that both compartments become one. Then a nest&mdash;or more, if
there are several hens&mdash;is hung up in position by hooks to the wire. For small
birds, a small one; for longer birds, such as the Belgians, etc., a larger one. They
are made of leather, lined with lambskin with wool on it, and ready for use, so that
the birds do not receive or want any building material. It cannot be pulled to
pieces. When once used it can be washed and be nice and clean for a second
nesting, so that there is no fear of insects troubling the birds. Feeding and
cleaning of cages takes only a few minutes daily. The eggs and the young ones
can be looked at at any time without frightening the birds; they get used to their
keeper and lose all fear. Is it to be wondered at, then, that the young also are
strong, bold-looking birds?&#8217;</p>

<p>Referring to the <a href="#FigXLVI03">German cage</a> figured on <a href="#Page_405">page 405</a>, he adds: &#8216;I forgot to
mention that the cage is divided into two compartments by a wire partition. When
the old birds go to nest a second time the young ones are shut up into the smaller
compartment; the old ones will continue to feed them through the wire as long
as it is necessary.&#8217;</p>

<p>Well now, if you have done all I told you, if you are the proud owner of a good
box of tools, many, if not all of which, mind, you can buy for very little, second-hand,
at any dealer&#8217;s or broker&#8217;s, and if you have managed to make a breeding cage,
you are capable of making any other kind of cage or hutch either. I do not refer
to those dandy all-wire and painted-tin businesses. You can try your hand at these
if you like, but as I do not approve of them, on the principle that all birds should
have a partially shut-in cage, as they dearly love a little privacy, I shall
not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
describe the process of manufacture. You will, however, naturally wish your cages
to look nice. Well, varnish the front with the ordinary mahogany varnish of the
shops, having first rubbed the woodwork very smooth.</p>

<p>I have spent so much time over directions for cage-making that my space is
small in which to deal with hutches. I do not regret it, however, for the boy that can
make a cage can make a hutch. He has only to see one and carefully examine it.</p>

<p>The same kind of hutch that is used for
rabbits does excellently well for guinea-pigs.</p>

<p>Now you can make a very serviceable
hutch out of that useful article a bacon box.</p>

<p>First it must be thoroughly washed and
cleaned and exposed for a day or two to the
weather. Then if meant to stand under cover,
in, say, an outhouse, you simply make a doorway
and cover it with galvanized iron network,
price about twopence a yard, and cover all the front, with the exception of about a
foot (this to be covered with wood), with the same kind of network. The bottom
of the box should be covered with zinc for cleanliness&#8217; sake. This is an ordinary
hutch. The breeding hutch is different, as there must be a dark retiring room for
the mother and young. The floors of hutches ought to slant a little forwards, and
they ought to be always well raised off the ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLVI06">
<img src="images/illo410.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="240" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 6.&mdash;Hutches.</p>
</div>

<p>Squirrels&#8217; and rats&#8217; cages are easily made, and a good deal of amusement can
be got out of these animals if they are well treated and have plenty of room.
Both rats and squirrels like a dark retiring or sleeping compartment; this should
have a door behind. Personally, I think the ordinary wheel arrangement is cruel.
I do not like to see an animal that contributes to our amusement condemned to
penal servitude and the treadmill.</p>

<p>Different kinds of birds require differently arranged cages, but whenever you
make up your mind to keep any kind of bird as a pet, go boldly to work and make
a cage for it, if needs be, borrowing one as a pattern for the purpose.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVII.&mdash;HOW TO MAKE A CAGE FOR WHITE MICE.<br />
<span class="smcap">By W. G. Campbell.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">To make a cage with sleeping-boxes in the upper part, and a ladder for the mice to
ascend and descend by, is by no means a difficult operation, nor does it cost an
exorbitant price; and it is very pleasant to watch the inhabitants climbing up and
down, and running in and out of the holes in their upstairs rooms, and also to see
the small animals swinging about in their boat-swings; nor, after one or two days,
do they seem at all to wish to get out, or to gnaw their bars, as many mice do if
confined in a narrow space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>I will first give a list of the materials and their cost, and after that proceed to
describe how the cage is to be made<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>These articles can be readily obtained at any ironmonger&#8217;s or smith&#8217;s, except the
emery-paper, which an oilman would supply. The thick wire should be about as
thick as a thin knitting-needle, the other wire, as it is for binding purposes, should
be as thin as possible; so also should the zinc; the hinges ought to be about an
inch long; the iron bar will be described as hereafter.</p>

<p>The wood should be <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. thick. The cage that I made, and which was a very neat
one, was formed from a box and some loose pieces of wood obtained from a
grocer for 4d.</p>

<p>First of all the pieces B B should be nailed at the ends of A, leaving 1 in. of A
projecting at back, and then from the top of each of them a strip 5 in. by <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. should
be cut, so that the piece C can now be nailed to join the ends and form front half
of cover; across upper half of back we will next nail D: the framework is thus
finished.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLVII01">
<img src="images/illo412.jpg" alt="cage" width="474" height="500" />
</div>

<p>Now let us make the sleeping-boxes. First we must with a centrebit bore three
holes an inch in diameter in piece F for entrances to nests; then let us nail G
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
G&acute; on one side of F to divide sleeping-box into three equal compartments; to these
we should next nail E, projecting 1<sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. beyond F to form run in front of nests.
Two holes should then be bored with a bradawl near the front edge of this run,
opposite middle hole to F, to receive ends of ladder, which will be described hereafter.
Next we must tack a strip of zinc along this run with eight or nine tacks,
punching small holes just above those bored with bradawl; then nail the sleeping-boxes
thus made to B B&acute; and D as shown in drawing, leaving a slit of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. between F
and back edge of C through which a piece of zinc 4 in. by 17 in. is to be slipped,
to keep the mice in their boxes while cleaning out the cage. The ends, bottom,
and large door should then be lined with zinc inside, leaving a space of
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
round front of cage, where the wires are to come; and just under the holes bored in
the run outside sleeping-box punch two others the same distance apart in the zinc
which lines the bottom&mdash;these are to hold the lower spikes of the ladder. The zinc
should be tacked down as much as possible as well in the middle as at the edges,
having holes punched in it for the tacks to go through.</p>

<p>Now bore holes <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. apart along C, and same
in but not through A, about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in.
from front edge of each, then cut off from your wire enough pieces 12<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. long to
go through these holes, which will be about sixty-eight in number. Let the wood
of A be quite <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. thick or a little more, so that the wires can have as much hold in
it as possible. Straighten your wires, emery-paper them, and push them through
the top holes, and bring them down to the corresponding ones in the bottom; then
fix two longitudinal wires from B to B&acute; across the front of the others, and bind these
upright wires to them with the pliant wire.</p>

<p>Hinge the doors to D, as shown in drawing, and splay front edge of each of
small doors, K, K&acute; and K&acute;&acute;, and top edge of F, so that these doors may shut closely.
Each small door should also have a hole made with the centrebit in the middle, and
a piece of perforated zinc should be tacked over them inside to ventilate the nests.
We now come to the ladder. Get two pieces of wood 8<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>
in. long by <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. broad
and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> thick, and make holes every
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. along them, and in each end of them bore
a hole, and drive a piece of thick wire <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in.
long in all these end holes, leaving <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in.
projecting from top ends, and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. from bottom; then break off enough pieces 1 in.
long to go into remaining holes of one of your sticks, and drive them in, but not so
as to come through the other side; then drive the other ends into the remaining
stick, and your ladder is finished. The boat-swings can be easily made in the same
manner after looking at drawing, and fastened at the top of the wire that they are
hung by with two staples to floor of sleeping-box. The fastenings can be made
from staples, those marked <i>a</i> for large door, and <i>b</i> for small doors; the hooks of <i>a</i>
should be put a little lower than middle of large door and the catches in ends of
cage.</p>

<p>Thin strips of zinc should be tacked in any places where the mice could gnaw the
wood.</p>

<p>Now, if you are going to have a handle, get as small an iron one as will
comfortably lift your cage, and screw it on to C, as near sleeping-boxes as possible;
then, as you will find the sleeping-box side will be the heavier, you might get a bar
of old iron from an ironmonger or smith 18 in. long, between
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> in. and <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> in. thick,
and broad enough to make your cage weigh equally; have three holes drilled in it,
and screw it underneath the cage in front.</p>

<p>A few remarks more about the cage and its inhabitants, and I shall have
finished.</p>

<p>The cage must have sawdust strewed on the floor and hay in the nests; the
former must be changed once a day, and the latter every other day, or at least twice
a week. If you cannot get sawdust anywhere else, an oilman will let you have
enough to last you a month for twopence. In such a cage as I have described a
&#8216;boar&#8217; and six &#8216;sows&#8217; may be kept. When a sow is about to have young it should
be put in a small cage by itself, and as soon as the young are old enough to eat
and run about they may be turned with their mother into this big cage.
Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
they will get chased about a little at first, but they will not be hurt, and will be all
right by the next morning. As soon as they are a month or six weeks old they
should be removed elsewhere. Only one <i>full-grown</i> boar should be kept in a
cage.</p>

<p>When mice are first put in such a cage as I have described, the ladder appears
steep for them, but they soon get used to it, and reach their nests in two or three
bounds from the ground.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVIII.&mdash;MUSICAL GLASSES AND THE WOOD
HARMONICON.</h3>

<h4 class="fsize80">I.&mdash;THE GLASS HARMONICON.</h4>

<p class="noindent">The harmonicon is not a very difficult instrument to make. It consists of a box
and a series of plates&mdash;of metal, stone, or glass&mdash;to give the sounds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLVIII01">
<img src="images/illo417a.jpg" alt="harmonicon" width="500" height="141" />
<p class="caption">FIG 1</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLVIII02">
<img src="images/illo417b.jpg" alt="harmonicon" width="500" height="161" />
<p class="caption">FIG 2</p>
</div>

<p>Take a piece of deal free from knots and shakes, and plane it smooth and true.
Let it be of the shape of <a href="#FigXLVIII01">Fig. 1</a>, three-sixteenths of an inch thick, six and a half
inches wide at the top, four and an eighth inches wide at the bottom, and twenty-three
and a half inches along the side which is at right angles to the ends. The
slope will be just a trifle longer.</p>

<p>This piece of wood is for the bottom of the box. Now for the sides. Make
them out of quarter-inch stuff, twenty-three and a half inches long and one inch and
five-eighths wide. For the ends take two pieces of three-eighths stuff an inch and
five-eighths wide; and let one be six and a half inches and the other four inches
long. For the tops, as shown in <a href="#FigXLVIII02">Fig. 2</a>, take two slips a quarter of an inch thick
and two inches wide at one end, and an inch and a half wide at the other.</p>

<p>Let the wood be as perfect in quality and equal in thickness as possible, and
glue up the box&mdash;without the tops&mdash;as evenly as you can. The box can be nailed
or screwed if you think it will be easier for you, but the result will not be so satisfactory.
The box is like a fiddle, and the more of a perfect shell it is the truer and
fuller will be the sound.</p>

<div class="figc550">

<div class="figleft" id="FigXLVIII03">
<img src="images/illo417c.jpg" alt="harmonicon" width="308" height="77" />
<p class="caption">FIG 3</p>
</div>

<div class="figright" id="FigXLVIII04">
<img src="images/illo417d.jpg" alt="harmonicon" width="206" height="77" />
<p class="caption">FIG 4</p>
</div>

</div><!--figc550-->

<p>In the centre of the box glue in the bridge, which will be about five and a
quarter inches long and half an inch wide, and should stand clear of the bottom and
clear of the tops. Then in the broad end, at two and a quarter inches from its
sides, cut the slots, as shown in <a href="#FigXLVIII03">Fig. 3</a>; and at the other end, as shown in <a href="#FigXLVIII04">Fig. 4</a>,
cut the slots one inch and a quarter from each side. Below each slot is shown a
small circle. This represents the head of the screw or tack round which the twine
is strung on which the musical plates are to rest.</p>

<p>For the string use very fine twine, crochet cotton, or silk, and stretch it very
tightly, and fasten it off at the end it started from; that is to say, fix it at the broad
end under the tack, then pass it under the tack at the narrow end, then under
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
other tack at the narrow end, and then bring it up to the broad end and there
finish it off. It should be very tight, and just rest on the bridge in the middle.</p>

<p>The next thing is the glass, which should be cut in inch strips, and fixed on to
the strings with a drop of sealing-wax. Let us have eighteen notes ranging from B
to E in the key of C. The true dimensions and position will have to be found by
experiment, but for glass a sixteenth of an inch in thickness the following will be
found the suitable lengths. B should measure five and three-eighths; C, five and a
quarter; D, five; E, four and seven-eighths; F, four and five-eighths; G, four and
a half; A, four and three-eighths; B, four and a quarter; C, four and an eighth;
D, three and three-quarters; E, three and five-eighths; F, three and a half; G,
three and three-eighths; A, three and a quarter; B, three and an eighth; C, three
and an eighth; D, three and an eighth; E, two and three-quarters. These are the
lengths for glasses an inch in width.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLVIII05">
<img src="images/illo417e.jpg" alt="harmonicon" width="500" height="58" />
<p class="caption">FIG 5</p>
</div>

<p>The glasses should be laid on the strings, which gradually approach each other,
and they should be shifted about until the correct note for each is obtained. In
<a href="#FigXLVIII01">Fig. 1</a> we have shown how they rest on the strings, and in <a href="#FigXLVIII02">Fig. 2</a> we have boxed
them in and shown by the space at the end how they may have to be closed up to
keep the proper intervals. As soon as the notes are right, fix the glasses on to the
string with a tiny drop of sealing-wax. And also fasten the string on to the bridge
with wax so as to make everything secure. Then glue on the tops to hide the
ragged ends, and the harmonicon is complete. For the hammers glue a piece of
cork or wood on to a length of whalebone or split cane, or any springy stick about
eight inches long. A convenient shape is that shown in <a href="#FigXLVIII05">Fig. 5</a>, where the black
head represents the cork cut to a wedge.</p>

<p>Although many tunes can be very pleasingly played on this simple instrument,
do not let it be supposed that it at all resembles the harmonica for which music was
written by the great composers. That was a different affair altogether. Perhaps a
few notes concerning it may not be uninteresting.</p>

<p>One of the first allusions to an instrument of the sort is by Harsd&ouml;rfer in 1677,
though among savage nations, Burmese and what not, rock, bone, and wood harmonicas
have existed for ages. On St. George&#8217;s Day in 1746, Gluck played a
concerto on twenty-six drinking-glasses, &#8216;tuned with spring water.&#8217; The instrument
was of his own invention, and he played it accompanied by the whole band. It
was said to be capable of producing all the effects of the violin and harpsichord.</p>

<p>When Benjamin Franklin was in London in 1762, he saw Puckeridge and
Delaval amusing themselves by playing tunes on ordinary drinking-tumblers. The
tumblers were tuned by the water poured into them up to different levels&mdash;the
higher the water the lower the note&mdash;and were sounded by wiping a wet finger
round their brims. Franklin was so much struck with this that he straightway took
the matter in hand and invented the harmonica, for which the music used to be
written, and of which a specimen now rests in the South Kensington Museum.</p>

<p>The harmonica&mdash;Franklin called it the &#8216;armonica&#8217;&mdash;consisted of a series of
glass bells fixed in regular order on an iron spindle made to revolve like a lathe
with a treadle. The sound was produced by pressing the wet fingers on the bells as
they rotated, and it could be increased or decreased in volume and tone by varying
that pressure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>Franklin presented his invention to the Davies family, with whom he was
connected, and one of them, Marianne, performed on it with great success in
London, Paris, Florence, and Vienna. The constant thrilling of the fingers affected
her nerves, however, and she had to abandon it, just in the same way as had
Naumann, the composer, who &#8216;found it necessary to restrict himself in practising.&#8217;</p>

<p>Some of the music played by Miss Davies was specially written for the instrument
by Hasse; and when, in 1791, the blind Kirchg&auml;ssner went to Vienna, Mozart wrote
an adagio and rondo in C for harmonica, flute, oboe, violin, and violoncello. Who in
these days would imagine that the &#8216;musical glasses&#8217; once stood so high in the world?</p>

<p>Three years afterwards Kirchg&auml;ssner came to London, and there played on a new
harmonica built by Fr&ouml;schel. At Darmstadt the harmonica held its place in the
Court orchestra, and C. F. Pohl &#8216;professed&#8217; it. Beethoven even condescended to
write for &#8216;the glasses,&#8217; and Naumann&#8217;s half-dozen sonatas for them still exist.</p>

<p>The instrument, however, has been laid on the shelf&mdash;or rather consigned to its
case as a curiosity&mdash;and the musical glasses of to-day are the harmonicon we have
described, and the tumblers about which we may now say a word.</p>

<h4 class="fsize80" id="Ref21">II.&mdash;MUSICAL TUMBLERS.</h4>

<p>Musical glasses have been arranged in many ways. Sometimes they have been
all of one size, and the different tones have been produced by varying quantities of
water placed in them. This, however, was
a troublesome and clumsy way of getting
effects.</p>

<p>Another method was to place forty-one
parallel glass cylinders of equal length and
thickness on a perpendicular sounding-board.
These tubes were wetted and
stroked, the music varying by the greater
or less pressure of the performer&#8217;s fingers.
This, it is obvious, must have been a
difficult instrument to play.</p>

<p>The musical glasses originally arranged
by Dr. Arnott are undoubtedly the best,
and with a little patience can be easily
and cheaply made by anyone. The
patience is required to hunt up glasses
having the required notes on them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLVIII06">
<img src="images/illo419.jpg" alt="musical glasses" width="250" height="232" />
</div>

<p>We give a <a href="#FigXLVIII06">drawing</a> of this above. The open circles represent the mouths
of the glasses standing in a wooden case. The relation of the glasses to the
written musical notes is shown by the lines and spaces which connect them.
The learner will see at once that one row produces the notes written upon the lines,
the other row those in the spaces. There are two octaves, and the player stands by
the <i>side</i> of the case, with the notes ascending towards the right hand, as in the
pianoforte. The sounds are produced by passing the moistened fingers round the
edges of the glasses. A little gum dissolved in the water makes the fingers &#8216;bite&#8217;
better, and produces a greater volume of sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<h4 class="fsize80">III.&mdash;A WOOD HARMONICON.</h4>

<p>In the section on &#8216;<a href="#Ref21">The Musical Glasses</a>&#8217; we gave at length the details of
construction of a glass harmonicon. An instrument of the same character made of
wood is now, it seems, taking a place in the French orchestras, and we herewith
give an <a href="#FigXLVIII07">illustration</a> of the latest form of the so-called &#8216;Xylophone&#8217; as used in
Paris, with the names of the
notes marked in the French
manner, wherein the ancient
&#8216;Ut&#8217; does duty for the modern
&#8216;Do.&#8217;</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLVIII07">
<img src="images/illo420.jpg" alt="xylophone" width="355" height="550" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLVIII08">
<img src="images/illo421.jpg" alt="xylophone" width="500" height="453" />
</div>

<p>The curious in such matters
must have noticed the wide distribution
of the bamboo harmonicon.
Some such instrument
for the production of sharp,
short sounds can be traced back
to the old Greeks and Hebrews,
and is found to-day amongst the
Russians and Cossacks and
Tartars of the Steppe, and the
mountaineers of the Urals and
Carpathians. Even in Sicily, in
1742, a wooden harmonicon
was described under the name
of the Xylonganum, and the
wooden slips analogous to the
nigger-bones laid on strings are
mentioned as forming a German
&#8216;music-maker&#8217; more than three
centuries ago. In 1830 Gussikow,
a Russian, made a tour of
Europe with a xylophone composed
of wood and straws, the
straws taking the place of the
strings and tapes; and straws,
it may be as well to observe,
are excellent substitutes for the
strings in a glass harmonicon.
There is no difference in the treatment of these suspenders, and the arrangement
given in our plan herewith does equally well for both.</p>

<p>Of the instrument very little explanation is required. A number of pieces of
wood, metal, bones, or stones are selected which will give the required tone when
struck by a small hammer, and these are arranged on strings which are tightened
over a shallow wooden box, being fastened with a small lump of sealing-wax to keep
them in position. The harder the wood chosen for the palettes the better will
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
the sound; and if one good piece can be met with to give the set, the various sizes
will give the tones almost without any variation. The straighter the grain the
truer the sound; and though hard wood, such as oak and mahogany, is as a rule
the best, yet pieces of ordinary deal will sometimes be found more musical. Some
years ago we remember hearing a harmonicon made entirely out of a bundle of
firewood scattered along a couple of waxed threads, and admirably was it played by
the maker. There being no sustaining power in the materials, only very rapid tunes
could be performed satisfactorily, but the sailor&#8217;s hornpipe on this bundle-wood
harmonicon was quite a success. The notes being clear, sharp, and unmistakable,
the very quick country dance and marching tunes could be delivered with great
effect owing to there being no blurring of sounds. In combination with a piano or
violin the xylophone is not to be despised, and in the orchestras wherein it has now
been introduced it will probably prove more effective than is generally supposed.
Being cheap, and easily made, it is worth having a try at.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIX.&mdash;&AElig;OLIAN HARPS, AND HOW TO MAKE THEM.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The simplest pattern of &AElig;olian harp is that which fits into any ordinary window
frame. A box of thin straight-grained, well-planed deal is glued together, having
a length equal to that of the width of the window for which it is destined, a depth of
four or five inches, and a breadth of five or six inches. The wood of which it is
made is carefully planed on both sides, and is not over an eighth of an inch in thickness,
and the joints are as true and clean as it is possible to make them. The more
carefully this box is made the better will be the tone of the instrument.</p>

<p>The bridges in all &AElig;olian harps are of some hard wood, such as oak, box, or
elm, and are glued on to the face of the sounding-case. They are about half an
inch high and a quarter of an inch thick. The strings are of catgut tightened by
pegs screwed into the edges of the case, which are occasionally strengthened for the
purpose by a thin fillet of beech. The strings are tuned in unison. Three inches
above them is placed a thin board, supported on four pegs, one at each corner of
the case. The harp is rested on the bottom of the window frame, and the sash is
brought down on the upper board. The air passes in and out between it and the
sounding-box, and the strings being set in vibration give off that soft,
melodious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
murmur which, in a more subdued tone, is heard near telegraph posts when the
wires are shaken by the wind.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLIX01">
<img src="images/illo422.jpg" alt="aeolian harp" width="500" height="397" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>This is the ordinary &AElig;olian harp, but in this country and on the Continent there
are many more complicated forms of the instrument in existence. The &AElig;olians of
the four Strasburg Cathedral towers, for instance, are well known to tourists. At
the castle of Baden Baden also the harps are a great attraction, and we here give a
<a href="#FigXLIX01">sketch</a> of one of the loudest of these celebrated instruments.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLIX02">
<img src="images/illo423a.png" alt="aeolian harp" width="395" height="550" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>

<p class="largeillo"><a href="images/illo423alg.png">Fig. 2 enlarged</a> (89 kB)</p>

<p>It is set well back in the gallery, and the window opening is gradually contracted
by the curious shed, of which one side is removed to show the construction, the air
passing out through the grating, which is only slightly wider than the harp. Of the
harp itself we give the <a href="#FigXLIX02">plan and section</a>, and to avoid fractions we retain its original
measurement in m&egrave;tres and centim&egrave;tres&mdash;sixty-one centim&egrave;tres being as nearly as
possible two feet, and a m&egrave;tre being a hundred centim&egrave;tres, or thirty-nine inches
and three-eighths.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that this pattern of the instrument has strings on both sides,
and that the inner edge of the box is fitted with narrow sound-holes. The front of
the box is of thin wood steamed into shape, and fitted round the curved ends as
carefully as the sides are built into the back and belly of a violin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>In <a href="#FigXLIX03">Kircher&#8217;s harp</a>, the older form, the screen fits into a window, the instrument
is hung on an iron rod, and has a great many strings stretched over broad sound-holes.
The case is freely perforated, and is hung so as to half overlap the aperture
which gives admittance to the air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigXLIX04">
<img src="images/illo424.jpg" alt="aeolian harp" width="350" height="440" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.</p>
</div>

<p>Kircher for a long time had the credit of being the inventor of the &AElig;olian harp,
but it is of much earlier date. It is, in truth, a very obvious contrivance, easily
made, and not susceptible of much improvement. In our last <a href="#FigXLIX04">figure</a> we give its
latest form, which differs from the others only in the arrangement of the screens.
These are devised to throw a strong draught on to the strings, without having to be
fitted into a window frame; but in this, as in all the other forms of the wind harp,
it requires a pretty strong breeze to bring out its full tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER L.&mdash;THE PENNY WHISTLE, AND HOW TO PLAY IT.<br />
<span class="smcap">By W. J. Gordon.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">The best penny whistles are tuned in D, and we shall assume that ours is so.
Occasionally, however, they are in a different key, but this does not alter the
fingering, as the intervals are the same, and the same air will be played with the
same stopping. There are six holes, which, commencing from the mouthpiece end,
we will number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Of these holes, 1, 2, and 3 should be worked
by the fingers of the left hand; 4, 5, and 6 by those of the right.</p>

<p>The lowest note of the instrument is sounded when all the holes are stopped&mdash;the
reason, of course, being that the vibration takes place along its whole length. To
get this note is, however, not easy, as there is a great tendency to blow too strongly,
and so get into overtones. &#8216;The very gentlest breath will give the dulcet note we
seek.&#8217; Having got the D, and it must be a good full note, unstop 6, so as to keep
only 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 shut, and you will with the same strength of wind sound E, the
note that comes just above it in the scale.</p>

<p>F-sharp, the next note, is got by unstopping 5 and 6; G, the next, by unstopping
4, 5, and 6; A, the next, by unstopping 3, 4, 5, and 6; B, the next, by unstopping
2, 3, 4, 5, and 6; C-sharp by unstopping all the holes.</p>

<p>Nothing can be easier of remembrance than this. The fingers are lifted from
the holes one after the other, beginning at the bottom of the instrument, and with
every finger you lift you rise to a higher note. But we have not quite finished the
octave. How do you get the D? By leaving 1 open and closing the rest. And
one note we passed, C-natural, how is that obtained? By unstopping 1, 5, and 6.</p>

<p>We have thus gone from D to D and got our first octave. How do we get the
next? By blowing a little stronger, a very little, and unstopping on the same
principle as before. Beginning with D, we have 1 unstopped, and then closing 1
and opening 6 we get E; opening 5 and 6 we get F-sharp; opening 4, 5, and 6 we
get G; opening 3, 4, 5, and 6 we get A; and opening 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 we get B, just
as we did before, the fingering being the same, but the notes, owing to the stronger
blowing, being an octave higher. The next note, C-natural, is obtained by unstopping
1 and 6; the next, C-sharp, is given by clearing 1, 5, and 6; the next, D,
by clearing 1, 4, 5, and 6. And so we have completed our second octave. But
we have four more notes yet that can be safely sounded without giving our
audience the ear-ache, and of these E is got by unstopping 3 and 6, F-sharp by
unstopping 2 and 5, G by unstopping 2, 4, 5, and 6, and A by unstopping 1 and
6. We thus have a range of twenty-one notes, including the two C-sharps and
three F-sharps, so that our instrument is by no means a defective one, and the
only difficulty in playing it is the avoidance of overtones where the artistic merit
comes in at the middle D. It is, however, easy to remember that if you blow
softly you get the lower octave, if you blow firmly you get the higher octave,
if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
you blow wildly you get the peculiarly
metallic screech which has made the
penny whistle the abhorred of civilised
men.</p>

<p>And now, having cleared the ground&mdash;for
it is not our place here to teach
the &#8216;rudiments of music,&#8217; and in showing
how to produce the notes we have
gone as far as we need in a &#8216;monograph&#8217;
such as this&mdash;we will unfold the
little scheme we had in view when we
started on this description, and introduce
to our readers the Boy&#8217;s Own Mechanical
Penny Whistle!</p>

<p>The principle of the whistle, and,
indeed, of all instruments of the flute and
flageolet type, being that certain of the
holes in different combinations should
be left open in order to give the different
notes, and that the expression should be
given by the modulation of the wind
strength, it follows that the fingering is
merely mechanical. A substitute for
the fingering can therefore be found, and
the simplest substitute we have come
across is a sheet of wrapping-paper!</p>

<p>Take a strip of brown paper or
manilla paper, just wide enough to cover
the holes on the whistle, or rather overlapping
about half an inch on each side
of the end holes. Mark off on the paper
at each end of the strip where the centres
of the holes come, and rule parallel lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
the whole length of the paper, so that as it pulls over the whistle each of the six
lines will pass exactly over the centre of each of the six holes. On each side of
these six lines draw a line so that the space between the two new lines on each
side of the central one may be half as wide again as the diameter of the hole
across which it is to move.</p>

<p>Now rule the paper crossways in lines three-sixteenths of an inch apart parallel
to each other, and strictly at right angles to the lengthway lines. The strip is
now ready for you to stop out your tune on the principle of the Jacquard loom
or the American organettes
now so common
amongst us.</p>

<p>First find the shortest
note the air contains&mdash;in
our example, the &#8216;Blue
Bells of Scotland,&#8217; this is
a quaver&mdash;and each of
the ruled spaces cut by
the lines through the
whistle-holes must represent
this interval of
sound. Double the space
will give double the interval
of sound, and hence,
if one space represents a
quaver, two spaces will
represent a crotchet. In
the Blue Bells the first
note is D, a crotchet;
and as D is produced by
unstopping 1, we fill up
on the first line a double
space. The next note
is G, a minim; and, as G
is produced by unstopping
4, 5, and 6, we fill
up space on those lines,
making them double the length of the first space, the note being double as long.
The third note is a crotchet, F-sharp, and this is marked by blacking in 5 and 6.
There is no need to continue this explanation in detail, as the method is sufficiently
clear, and the notes are given in <a href="#FigL01">Fig. 1</a>, and can be compared with the scale. One
space equals a quaver, two spaces a crotchet, four a minim, in this instance; but
should a quicker tune be selected the spaces may have to be given values of less
interval. The simplest plan is to find the shortest note, and then, seeing how
many of it would go to a bar, to mark off the bars along the edge of the scale, and
then fill in at your ease. In our example eight spaces go to a bar, because the
shortest note is a quaver, and eight quavers make the semibreve. Having filled
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
the notes, take a sheet of glass, lay the paper on it, and with a sharp penknife cut
away all the spaces you have blacked&mdash;in short, make a stencil of your brown
paper.</p>

<p>We are now ready to commence. Hang the stencil over the whistle so that the
holes you have made in it pass over the whistle holes, and blow gently as you drag
it along. As the holes are cleared one after the other the notes are given forth, and
the whistle can be played almost as easily as a barrel-organ&mdash;if you can only keep
the paper straight and flat on to the tin. But this is not always easy to do, and so
we require a further invention, which the accompanying sketches sufficiently describe.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#FigL02">Fig. 2</a> is a piece of deal, the shaded part of which shows where it is to be cut
away. Two of these blocks, each of them about three inches long and two inches
wide, are required. <a href="#FigL03">Fig. 3</a> shows one of the blocks after it is in shape. The top
groove in one must be larger and deeper than that in the other, owing to the tapering
form of the whistle&mdash;for the whistle must fit firmly. Two rollers, made by sawing
pieces off a broomstick, are taken of sufficient width to carry your stencil easily, and
these are fixed as shown in <a href="#FigL04">Fig. 4</a>. One has a handle made of bent wire, with the
point that is driven into the roller flattened out and hammered in straight, so as to
give a firm hold; the other has two spindles only.</p>

<p>The rollers are fitted with an elastic band, so as to keep them close together
and make them act as a miniature mangle. A slip of wood is fastened beneath the
blocks to keep them in position. If it is intended to play the air through only
once, and to shift for each repetition, a weight is affixed to one end of the paper to
keep it flat; if, however, the air is to be repeated without a pause, the ends of the
stencil have simply to be pasted together, and a flanged roller hung in the loop, as
shown in the cut.</p>

<p>This is all the contrivance consists of. It is effective, and easily made. The
only difficulty in playing with it is the need of the stronger blow in the upper octave,
a difficulty soon mastered after a little careful practice. The principle of the
perforated keyboard is applicable to so many instruments that these rough notes on
its construction may prove valuable, even if it be not applied to the humble whistle.
The humble whistle! Alas! But let it not be imagined that squeals and screeches
are the sounds the poor whistle was made to produce. Any other instrument, if
improperly used, will give forth its appalling overtones. Treat it properly, gently,
and firmly, and you will find it as sweet-toned as a flageolet.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LI.&mdash;CURIOSITIES OF ELECTRICITY.<br />
<span class="smcap">By Dr. Arthur Stradling.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">In the whole history of science, from the Dark Ages down to the present time, there
has been no record of any parallel to the extraordinary progress which electricity has
made of late years.</p>

<p>It is comparatively but a short time since that people were marvelling at the
telegraph, and the newspapers used to write gushingly about &#8216;compelling the
lightning to bear our messages,&#8217; and all that sort of thing. I dare say many boys
who read this can remember what a sensation the electric light made when displayed
on the top of one of the buildings in the Strand&mdash;they need not be very old boys to
have seen it there. Nobody would be very much attracted by such a light anywhere
now.</p>

<p>There is scarcely a single art, manufacture, or science into which electricity has
not been pressed to do good service. Electric lighting has become a matter of
course, both indoors and out; and, while it has been proposed to <i>annihilate night</i> in
the city of Washington by setting up four huge electric &#8216;suns&#8217; on the hill of the
Capitol, so rendering any other illumination in the streets and houses as unnecessary
as in the day-time; a modified lamp of a few &#8216;candle-power&#8217; has recently been
devised for small rooms, supplied by a little battery which might stand on the
mantel-piece. Tennis is played and photographs are taken by the electric light;
electric bells are as common as door-knockers; electricity is proposed as a means of
killing sheep and bullocks in the slaughter-house and criminals on the scaffold, and
is used by the physician as a remedy for the preservation of life.</p>

<p>On board some of our great men-of-war the captain can sit in his cabin and not
only see the position of the helm, the speed of the ship, and the direction in which
she is steering, but can fire every gun she carries&mdash;all by electricity. Electricity
springs the deadly mine on the field of battle, and animates a sixpenny toy sold in
the Lowther Arcade. Even the railway engines, tram-cars, and screw-boats propelled
by electric force which have been lately invented cause but little surprise now,
so habituated have we become to the gigantic strides of this nineteenth-century
infant!</p>

<p>I am not going to preach a sermon upon it, however, as you may be expecting
from this terrific introduction; nor am I going to bore you with a lecture on coils
and currents and poles and induction, or any other technical details. But it occurs
to me that a brief mention of one or two of what may be termed the minor applications
of electricity&mdash;one or two only out of thousands&mdash;will perhaps interest you, as
illustrating how widely spread the influence of the science has become, and how it
penetrates into nearly all the affairs of life. To my mind, the fact of telegraph and
telephone wires stretching for hundreds of miles across uncleared jungles and
through virgin forests, as they do, is not half so strong an evidence of the pitch to
which it has arrived as its being adapted to a conjuring trick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>At one of the places of amusement in Paris some &#8216;sprites&#8217; carry wands which
sparkle out and fade again as required, flashing in time to the music. But a much
prettier and more elaborate arrangement has been brought out since, though I
believe it has not yet been presented to the public. The performer&mdash;magician,
fairy, or whatever he or she may be&mdash;wears a fancy dress, which is embroidered all
over with what look like large glass beads or imitation pearls. These are in reality
tiny electric lamps, all connected with each other by wires covered with silk in the
texture of the dress, and communicating with two little iron plates in the heels of
the fairy&#8217;s boots. Nothing remarkable, of course, is seen until these two iron discs
come into contact with a certain spot&mdash;which is reached just at the appropriate
moment&mdash;when every bead bursts into dazzling light, and the fairy becomes clothed
with white living fire in an instant! Then she steps away from the communication
with the batteries below, and the beads are as suddenly dead again.</p>

<p>Electric alarums for the detection of burglars have long been in vogue in the
shape of bells and gongs, so arranged as to be sounded directly the fastening of a
door or window is tampered with, and electric &#8216;booby-traps&#8217; have even been tried,
designed to give the thief a severe shock or take him prisoner&mdash;the result generally
being that the master of the house or the servants get caught in the snare themselves
half-a-dozen times, after which its use is discontinued.</p>

<p>The weak point in all these things has been that, from their costly and intricate
nature, they could not conveniently be applied to every accessible situation, and
that the mechanism was always liable to be thrown out of order. The burglars
would carefully avoid meddling with the shutters and doors to which these appliances
were known to be affixed, and would gain an entrance at some unprotected spot.
Now, however, somebody has patented an electric mat, which can be put down
anywhere at night, and which sounds an alarm directly an intruder steps upon it.</p>

<p>Galvanism is employed, as is well known, by medical men, to restore power to
paralysed limbs, to revive people who are faint almost to death, and to cure diseases.
Dentists owe a good deal to electricity, and their patients owe still more. When a
surgeon wants to cauterise some very small spot deep down in the flesh, instead of
cutting and burning all the way down, he now inserts a wire, which is shielded,
except just at the part which will come in contact with the bad place; an electric
current is sent through it, and the wire becomes red-hot.</p>

<p>Neater still is the way in which a needle is detected underneath the skin. I
dare say you know that such a thing often gives a doctor a great deal of trouble, and
it is an accident which you should be very careful to guard against. It frequently
occurs to boys who run about the house with bare feet. The needle, having no head
like a pin to stop it, slips right into the flesh. Sometimes the patient is not certain
whether it is there or not, as it may have worked out again, for the danger in these
cases arises from the tendency of the needle to <i>travel</i> through the flesh, doing great
mischief as it goes along. What is the doctor to do? If he is quite sure that it is
there and can feel it, he will of course cut it out; but he has to be very cautious.
A needle is so fine and slender, that sometimes, even when he thinks he can feel it
with the point of a probe, he finds himself mistaken. It has been suggested that a
magnet hung over the part will turn if any steel lie concealed beneath&mdash;a very pretty
theory, but one that does not answer when put into practice. But one may
make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
<i>quite</i> certain about it by probing the flesh with a little instrument which is connected
with a battery in such a way that directly the point touches metal the circuit is
completed and a bell rings.</p>

<p>Perhaps this was founded upon the very ingenious probe, by means of which the
great French surgeon, N&eacute;laton, discovered the bullet in Garibaldi&#8217;s foot. He could
feel <i>something</i> there, at the bottom of the wound; but whether it was only the bone,
or a bullet embedded in it, he could not say. So he made a slender probe of rough,
unglazed porcelain, and rubbed it against the hard substance. On withdrawing it,
he found it marked with lead!</p>

<p>Still more wonderful are the medical uses of the electric light. Not only is it made
to illuminate the eye to the very back, but the throat as well. A little glass-bead
lamp at the end of a rod is passed into the mouth, the current turned on, and there
you can see the tonsils, gullet, windpipe and all, a great deal more distinctly than the
interior of St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral on a foggy day: while, to a bystander, the patient&#8217;s
cheeks and throat look as if they were made of pink glass and filled with fire inside.
Further, a similar rod and bead have been actually lowered into the stomach of
a very thin person, and were found to be plainly visible through the semi-transparent
skin; and it is thought that this may be valuable at times in the detection of disease.</p>

<p>From surgery to sleight-of-hand is a long step, but we find conjurers quite as
eager to avail themselves of the assistance of electricity as doctors. Robert
Houdin&#8217;s book on Magic gives an account of the marvellous adaptations of this
science, wherewith his private house and park were furnished. He invented many
of the tricks performed with electric apparatus by his successors at the present day&mdash;not
such comparatively simple ones as &#8216;spirit-rapping&#8217; hammers and drums which
answer questions; but clever mysteries like the iron chest which a child can lift, yet
which defies the strength of a man, and the crystal cash-box. These are things
which might puzzle even scientific electricians who are not in the secret. By means
of the first the great wizard acquired extraordinary influence over the Arabs in
Algeria, because it seemed to them that he could at pleasure take away the strongest
man&#8217;s power in a moment and cause him to become as weak as a baby, restoring it
again as suddenly. It depends upon the fact that a current of electricity passed
through a bar of soft iron makes it into a huge magnet for the time being. The
little iron box, which is to be raised or remain immovable as the conjurer wills, is
placed upon a pedestal, within which is the iron bar, connected with wires to a
machine outside in charge of an assistant, who, at a given signal, turns on the current.</p>

<p>The crystal cash-box is a casket, the top, bottom, and sides of which are made
of glass, bound with wire at the edges. No deception seems possible; it is transparent
right through, and is suspended over the heads of the audience by four slender
wires attached to little hooks at the corners; yet several half-crowns are seen and
heard to fall down inside it at the word of command.</p>

<p>You will naturally guess that the entire affair is under the influence of a battery
&#8216;behind the scenes.&#8217; The coins are first concealed within a ground-glass ornamental
design in the lid, the glass of which is double. The lower slip would be just loose
enough to allow them to fall, but is kept up by a bit of black thread, which rests
against the wire. Just at this point the wire is made of platinum, which becomes
heated by electricity much more quickly than copper or iron, being a bad
conductor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
Almost the instant the current passes this bit of platinum becomes red-hot, while the
connecting wires are not affected; the thread is burnt through, down drops the slip
of glass, and the half-crowns fall or slide out with a jingle.</p>

<p>We know that by the telegraph wire we can read what people write hundreds of
miles away, and can hear what they say through the telephone. At the time when
all these &#8216;phones&#8217; and &#8216;graphs&#8217; were being invented, one after another, almost
daily, an American paper announced another novelty&mdash;the telegastrograph! You
were to hold one end of a wire in your mouth and taste the orange, plum-pudding,
or glass of wine into which the other end was stuck a thousand miles off! But
although this was a hoax, it would hardly have been more wonderful, had it been
true, than many real facts among the curiosities of electricity.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>CHAPTER LII.&mdash;THE LEYDEN JAR, AND HOW TO MAKE IT.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Nothing can be easier than to make the Leyden jar. Procure a smooth glass
bottle, that is to say an unpatterned one; and let it have a wide mouth, though this
is not essential. Thoroughly clean it and dry it, and paste on to it inside and out
to the height shown in the <a href="#FigLII01">illustration</a> some sheets of tinfoil. Let the tinfoil cover
the glass two-thirds or what not from the base, and leave no
breaks below the line.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLII01">
<img src="images/illo434.jpg" alt="Leyden jar" width="200" height="355" />
</div>

<p>The best plan is to coat the inside first. Cut a circular
piece of tinfoil a little larger than the bottom of the bottle,
and paste it down with the edge pressed up against the side.
Then drop into the bottle a well-pasted strip of foil the height
you have selected, and just a trifle longer than the internal
circumference of the glass on which it is to be stuck.</p>

<p>Having finished the inside, do the out. Cut a circular
plate for the bottom, press it up round the edge and paste on
the glass the strip for the exterior circumference, which should
be of the same height as that inside. Then insert a piece of
brass through a cork or mahogany stopper, fix a brass ball
to one end and a brass chain to the other just long enough
to rest on the bottom, wax or varnish the stopper, and the
jar is complete.</p>

<p>Instead of lining the bottle with tinfoil, thin gold leaf or
copper leaf can be used; and instead of the brass ball and bar a ball of baked
wood and a copper tube. It was Harris who first used the baked wood; Hopkinson
has experimented with Leyden jars in which sulphuric acid has taken the place
of tinfoil! The form we have described is, however, the usual one, and as it is the
cheapest it would be best to start with it.</p>

<p>To charge the jar the outside tinfoil is connected with the ground, and the
inside is excited by means of the knob from the prime conductor of the machine.
The electricity is, as the phrase goes, &#8216;bottled off,&#8217; though &#8216;the fluid&#8217; is no fluid,
and is not &#8216;poured&#8217; at all. Two conductors of large surface are separated by a rigid
insulator, and hence the conditions are favourable for powerful attraction. That is all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span></p>

<p>This simple apparatus, which takes such a prominent part in electrical experiments,
obtained its name from having been invented at the old Dutch University,
where Muschenbroek was at the time professor. In Germany it is called Kleist&#8217;s
jar, from the name of another inventor, but it has been the custom amongst us to
ascribe the honour of invention to either Muschenbroek, or Cuneus, his assistant.</p>

<p>It seems that Muschenbroek had noticed that excited electrics soon lost their
electricity in the open air, and that this loss was quickened when the atmosphere
was charged with moisture. Hence electricity was retained by surrounding its
retainer with bodies that did not conduct it. To prove this he poured some water
into a glass flask, put it into communication with the prime conductor of an electrical
machine, and for fear of accidents judiciously handed it over to Cuneus to hold.
When they thought it was charged enough, Cuneus tried to disconnect the chain
from the conductor, and thereupon received such a lively shock in his arms and
chest that he dropped the bottle and smashed it to pieces.</p>

<p>The professor was pleased; the assistant was not. He was ill for two days
afterwards. &#8216;I would not take another shock for the kingdom of France,&#8217; he wrote
to Reaumur. And all the first experimenters with electrical apparatus were much
alarmed at shocks which to us would seem hardly worth noticing. Poor Winkler,
for instance, was so frightened at the unexpected experience that he &#8216;betook himself
to cooling medicines to allay the fever.&#8217;</p>

<p>The shock received by Cuneus soon led up to the jar as we now know it. First
water was tried, then mercury, and finally tinfoil. Muschenbroek&#8217;s experiments
took place in 1746; in the next year Watson began to come to the front. He first
fired gunpowder by electricity, then he mixed camphor with gunpowder and discharged
muskets by electricity. Then hydrogen and spirits of wine were fired by
the spark by means of a drop of water or a lump of ice.</p>

<p>Watson it was who put the inside and outside tinfoil coatings on the jar. Bevis
suggested the outside; Smeaton, of Eddystone Lighthouse fame, suggested the
inside. Watson&#8217;s experiments before the Royal Society attracted much attention to
the science, though he had in some things been anticipated by the French, who had
sent a discharge through 12,000 feet, and on one occasion had used the great basin
of the Tuileries, giving an acre of water as part of the circuit.</p>

<p>Nollet sent a discharge from a jar through a regiment of 1500 men holding each
other&#8217;s hands, and they were all shocked in the arms and shoulders. But perhaps the
best known experiment is that of Franklin with his kite.</p>

<p>Two strips of cedar, fixed crosswise, with a large silk handkerchief tied at the
corners, and a sharp-pointed wire projecting a foot above the upright, was all that
Benjamin Franklin&#8217;s famous kite consisted of. It had an ordinary paper tail, a
bellyband, and a long fine string, with a short piece of silk ribbon tied at the end.
Just where the ribbon was knotted to the string he hung a key.</p>

<p>It was in June, 1752, when he let his kite up in the thunderstorm. He and his
son, after some little difficulty, got it out to the full length of the string, and then
stood up inside a doorway to keep the ribbon dry. A thundercloud passed over,
and nothing seemed to happen. The experiment promised to be a failure.
Gradually, however, the loose filaments of twine began to stand out at right angles,
and were found to be attracted by the fingers; then a knuckle held to the
key<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
extracted a spark from it, and as the string got thoroughly wet in the pouring rain
the electricity became abundant. With it the experimenters charged the Leyden
jar, whose discharges afterwards proved the identity of the electricity of the thundercloud
with the electricity of the machine.</p>

<p>Another famous experiment is that known as Lichtenberg&#8217;s figures. It is generally
performed as follows. Hold the jar, charged positively, in the hand, and with
the knob draw on a glass plate, cake of resin, or sheet of vulcanite, a series of
patterns. Then put the jar on an insulator, and, lifting it by the knob, trace
another series of patterns with the outer coating, so as to cross and intertwine with
those made by the knob. Having designed the patterns, make a mixture of red
lead and flowers of sulphur and dust it on to the slab. A curious thing will happen.
The red and yellow will sort themselves out. The sulphur will stick to the positive
lines, the lead to the negative ones, and the pattern will be given in two well-marked
colours. The sulphur will be in tufts, the lead in spots. In mixing the
powder the sulphur became negatively electrified, the red lead positively so, and
hence the disposition of the materials.</p>

<p>The terms negative and positive were first used by Symmer as alternatives for
resinous and vitreous. Symmer was the man who discovered the electricity in his
stockings and charged the jar by their aid. His experiments were the same in
principle as those of Cigna with his silk ribbons, but were much more astonishing.</p>

<p>When Symmer pulled off his stockings he noticed that they often gave a
crackling sound, and when he undressed in the dark he saw sparks issuing from
them. When he wore silk stockings for show and worsted beneath them for warmth
the effects were more powerful. When one stocking was drawn out of the other
they appeared inflated, and attracted and repelled each other like electrified bodies!</p>

<p>He experimented with a pair of white silk stockings and a pair of black silk
stockings. When he wore both white or both black on the same leg, nothing
happened; but when he wore a white and black on the leg, and pulled them off after
ten minutes or so, they remained inflated, and showed the shape of his leg! Brought
within eighteen inches of each other, they rushed together; then they were separated,
and again became inflated, and again rushed together.</p>

<p>Experimenting with the two pairs held against each other, he found that they
sorted themselves out, rushing each to each, until they gradually wasted away, and
from legs substantial enough for the foundation of a family ghost story&mdash;a ghostly
legacy&mdash;dwindled down into mere flabby pieces of silk. The electricity he obtained
from these classical stockings was considerable. He charged a Leyden jar from the
four of them, and secured enough electricity to shock himself up to his elbows, and
to light a teaspoonful of spirits of wine!</p>

<p>One caution before we conclude. In every experiment, whether it be merely in
shocking, in rendering luminous half-a-dozen eggs placed end to end by sending the
shock through them, in perforating a card by passing a spark through it as it
rests on the foil, in splitting wood by driving the wires in until their points are close
to each other, in breaking a glass by passing a spark from knob to knob in water,
however simple it may be, remember always to discharge by touching the outside
first. Otherwise you may receive an unpleasant surprise, and, like Cuneus, come to
grief with your Leyden jar.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LIII.&mdash;THE ELECTRICAL MACHINE, AND HOW TO
MAKE IT.</h3>

<p class="noindent">In our chapter on the Leyden Jar we assumed that those of our readers who were
likely to experiment in frictional electricity would be in possession of an electrical
machine to start with. Many, however, may be desirous of building an electrical
machine of their own. As this can be easily done, and as the cost of the materials
is comparatively slight, we purpose giving a few practical hints on the subject which
may be of use to those wishing to build and those anxious to repair if they only
knew how.</p>

<p>Before we deal with the cylindrical machine we must, however, devote a few
words to the electrophorus by which the jar can be charged if desired. An electrophorus
is easily made. Choose the lid of a tin canister about eight inches in
diameter and half an inch deep for your &#8216;form,&#8217; or have a lid specially made by a
tinsmith with its sharp edge turned over a wire ring, so that it may keep its shape
and not be so likely to cut your fingers. Let the tinsmith also make you a thin flat
disc of zinc or brass, smooth and rounded at the edges, and measuring about six
inches and a half across. To this disc solder three loops of brass wire, and to the
loops tie three silk strings of equal length, by which you can lift the disc. The silk
should be quite pure, and if you like something else you can use a handle made of
sealing-wax and stick it on to the centre. The silk strings, however, are the simplest,
strongest, and most easily replaced.</p>

<p>Turn the &#8216;form&#8217; bottom upwards, and run round it a strip of thick white paper,
so as to project about an inch above the bottom. This will be the mould into
which the mixture is to be poured, for the lid is always to be used bottom upwards.
In the old days the mixture was poured into the tin mould and left there, but it was
found that the cake would crack very easily under such circumstances, whereas when
it is left to itself it lasts for months with ordinary care. Make your mould, then,
with the lid for its bottom and the paper for its rim, and proceed to melt your
mixture. This should consist of yellow beeswax and Venice turpentine in equal
quantities by weight. Use an earthenware pot, and gradually warm up the mass,
stirring it with a piece of wood so as to ensure its melting equally. When it is
melted, you have to add to it five times its weight of shellac&mdash;that is to say, if you
used two ounces each of beeswax and turpentine, you will have to use twenty ounces
of shellac. The shellac is to be added to the melting mixture a handful at a time,
and all lumps must be dissolved before any more of the flakes are added. Do not
let the liquid get too hot, or it will become like india-rubber and spoil. When all
the shellac has been got in, take off the earthenware pot, give the mass a stir, and
carefully pour it out into your paper-edged mould, until the liquid is half an inch
deep. When the cake is cold, wet and tear off the paper, and then lift it off the tin.
If you drop the cake it will almost certainly break, but if you keep it free from hard
knocks it will last a long time. Do not have the cake too thick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>To use this electrophorus, turn your lid upside down, as you did during the
casting, and place the cake on the top, turning it also bottom upwards, so that the
smooth surface which came nearest the tin when it set is now the upper one. Let
the whole apparatus be warm and dry. Strike or rub the surface rapidly with a
piece of warm flannel or fur&mdash;fur is the best; and while you are beating the cake,
keep your fingers on it to prevent it slipping off its stand. When you think the cake
is sufficiently excited, which it will be in a minute or so, lay the cover in the centre,
holding it by the silk strings or handle. Touch the cover with your finger, and then
lift it from the cake, and you will get a powerful spark, and each time you touch the
cover, before you lift, the result will be the same. In dry weather the cake will
remain electrical for weeks, but it is better to recharge it each time it is used. Do
not let your clothes get too near the electrophorus during your experiment, and keep
all pointed things as far away from it as possible. An eight-inch electrophorus
ought to give an inch spark if properly made and charged. To charge the Leyden
jar, all you have to do is to hold the knob near the cover and take from fifty to a
hundred sparks. You should have the electrophorus raised so as not to have to lift
the cover too high each time, and you should hold the jar by its bottom, thus giving
the necessary connection with the earth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLIII01">

<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>The cylinder machine (<a href="#FigLIII01">Fig. 1</a>) is a much more complicated affair. It consists
of a stand <span class="smcapall">A</span>; a cushion, of which the upright
is shown at <span class="smcapall">B</span>, and from which the silk
flap is shown at the top; a cylinder, shown at <span class="smcapall">D</span>
with its caps <span class="smcapall">E</span> <span class="smcapall">E</span>, and its handle at
<span class="smcapall">F</span>; and a prime conductor <span class="smcapall">G</span>,
insulated on a glass rod <span class="smcapall">H</span>. It is best to buy the
cylinder. Glass confectionery jars, Winchester quarts, ordinary bottles, and even
commoner vessels have been used, but the results have rarely repaid the extra
trouble necessitated by the want of a cylinder with proper ends. Such a
cylinder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
about six inches long will cost under two shillings, and one of a fair size, say ten
inches long, can be obtained for five shillings from any chemical appliance seller,
such as Griffin, of Long Acre, or Townson and Mercer, of Bishopsgate Street
Within. Should a makeshift be adopted, the first step is to cement a disc of baked
wood on to each end of the bottle so as to afford the needful fixing. The cement
for the purpose should be made by melting rosin in an earthen pot, adding a little
beeswax and raw linseed oil to toughen it. For half a gallipot
full of rosin use a piece of wax about as big as a walnut, and
a teaspoonful of oil. When the rosin is thoroughly melted,
stir in some plaster-of-paris; and the more plaster you can
manage to make it take up the harder will be your cement.
The mixture must, however, be perfect. While it is liquid
shake in some red lead to give it a good colour. The cement
will have to be melted each time it is used, and the articles it
is required to join should be warmed before it is applied, so
that the change of temperature may be gradual.</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to provide our cylinder with an
axis. The simplest way to mount it is to run a hard wood
stick right through the centre, the stick being only just large
enough to pass, but the most workmanlike way is to fit it with
two hard wood ends. Unless, however, this be done with
great accuracy, the cylinder will not be properly centred, and the result will be a
failure. For beginners, therefore, it may be advisable to retain the central spindle.
Before inserting it thoroughly clean the cylinder inside and out.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLIII02">

<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>The spindle should project a few inches at each end; and to hide the glass
collars and give a strong grip, a pair of ends (see <a href="#FigLIII02">Fig. 2</a>) should be cut or turned
which can be slipped down the stick. These can be fastened to the glass with
cement, and further kept in place by a fine screw or French nail driven through to
the centre so as to just avoid the glass. In the case of the spindle not being driven
through, the ends are made longer, and on them the cylinder works. We have here
(<a href="#FigLIII03">Fig. 3</a>) the cylinder <span class="smcapall">A</span>
duly fitted with the central spindle <span class="smcapall">B</span>, with the collar <span class="smcapall">C</span> shown
by itself and in position, and the handle <span class="smcapall">D</span>
slipped on to the squared end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
the spindle. This handle should be made to fit firmly, and it is best to cut the
square hole in it first and then to cut the spindle end to suit it. Like the rest of the
machine it should be of hard
wood, and should have all
its corners and edges sand-papered
off.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLIII04">

<p class="caption">Fig. 5.</p>
</div>

<p>We must next make the
stand for the cylinder to
work on. Get a piece of
board an inch or more thick,
lay the cylinder on it, and
mark where the two ends
come at <span class="smcapall">G G</span> (<a href="#FigLIII04">Fig. 4</a>). The
cylinder is to revolve on the
spindle, and the ends are to
prevent its shifting from side
to side, so that your marks will be at the junction. Now get out two uprights from
the same thickness of board, and let them be twice the height of your cylinder&#8217;s
diameter; let one have a hole large enough for the spindle to work in, and let the
other have a slit from which the spindle can
be kept from rising by a pin run through, as
shown in <a href="#FigLIII05">Fig. 5</a>. When your uprights are
ready, cut the tongues at the end, and then
cut the holes in the board for them to stand
in. These holes will be to the outside of the
lines given by the cylinder, and should be on
one side of a line drawn through the centre
parallel to the sides of the board. Fit in your
uprights and try if the cylinder works freely in
them. If all is true and level, take them out
and glue them home.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLIII06">

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLIII07">
<img src="images/illo441b.jpg" alt="electrical machine" width="450" height="140" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.</p>
</div>

<p>The next thing to make is the cushion, for
which you require a block of wood, like <span class="smcapall">E E</span>
(<a href="#FigLIII06">Fig. 6</a>), an inch and a half wide, half an inch
thick, and not quite as long as the cylinder.
Cut a notch in the centre for the upright to be
fixed in, and then procure a piece of coloured
thin leather, or wash-leather, an inch longer
than the wood, and wide enough to go barely
round it. Glue it on to the top and bottom of
the wood so that it is quite loose in front, and
also glue up one end. When the glue is
thoroughly dry, stuff the cushion with horsehair
or tow, making it as uniform as possible. Glue up the open end. To the under
edge of the cushion glue the silk flap, which should pass up in front of the rubber
and over the top of the cylinder (see <a href="#FigLIII07">Fig. 7</a>). It
may be of oiled silk throughout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
or it may be made as follows. Glue a piece of leather the same as that used for
the cushion along the under edge of the wood. Should you have used a coloured
leather for the cushion, you will have to glue it coloured side down, so that the softer
surface may come next
the glass. This piece
of leather should be
the length of the
cushion and just wide
enough to reach to the
top. Along its upper
edge you have next to
glue a piece of black
sarcenet, and the
leather and the sarcenet
should together be
as long as the flap
would have been had
you made it entirely
of silk.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLIII08">

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLIII09">
<img src="images/illo441d.jpg" alt="electrical machine" width="350" height="147" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 9.</p>
</div>

<p>The cushion being
thus completed, you
have next to fix it to
an upright, and this
upright should be just
high enough to admit
of the cushion pressing
along the centre of the
cylinder. To increase
the power of the machine
you can, if you
like, glue a strip of
tinfoil along the bottom
of the rubber, connecting
it by a small chain
to a hook at its back,
from which hook a
chain hung on to the
nearest gaspipe affords
the best connection
with the earth. The
upright (<a href="#FigLIII08">Fig. 8</a>) is
affixed to a foot in
which a slide has been cut as shown at <span class="smcapall">K</span> in
<a href="#FigLIII09">Fig. 9</a>, where <span class="smcapall">N</span> is the position of the
screw and <span class="smcapall">L</span> is the hole for the upright, so that it can be slipped backwards and
forwards until the right pressure against the cylinder is obtained. A brass thumb-screw
will keep it in position, as shown in our first illustration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>For the prime conductor use a wooden rolling-pin covered with tinfoil. If you
have to prepare a piece of wood specially it is best to have it about two inches and
a half in diameter, and instead of making it round to make it with an egg-shaped or
pear-shaped section. This is, however, unusual at present, and a round stick is
much easier to get. Its ends should be well rounded off. Tinfoil is cheap enough,&mdash;it
costs about twopence-halfpenny a sheet, so that there is no need to be sparing
of it; it should be carefully pasted on to the wood with ordinary paste, and have
its edges notched so as to avoid wrinkles and folds. When it is dry, it should be
burnished with a knife-handle to make it as smooth as possible. When it is finished
off draw a line along it&mdash;in the case of a pear-shaped conductor let the line be along
its thinnest edge&mdash;and at a quarter of an inch apart drive in stout pins, which
should be filed off so that their points may be quite sharp and project about half an
inch. The length of the row of pins should be rather less than that of the cushion;
they should not run the whole length of the conductor, but stop about a couple of
inches from the end. The conductor should be the same length as the cylinder,
but it should be so fixed as to bring the row of pins immediately opposite the flap.
It thus stands a little to the right of the centre, away from the handle end. At the
longest end a thick wire is fixed, to which a brass ball is attached.</p>

<p>To support the conductor you require a glass rod, obtainable at the same time as
the cylinder, and costing a shilling a pound. It should be half an inch in diameter
and sufficiently long to fix well into the board and conductor, and bring the points
level with the centre of the cylinder. To get it to remain fast you will have to
roughen its ends on a grindstone and fasten them into holes with cement. It
should be so fixed as to bring the points of the conductor about half an inch from
the cylinder. Now cut the silk so that its edge is just above the row of pins; and
then give all the edges and corners a final sand-papering, and set about getting the
machine to work.</p>

<p>The first thing you have to do is to smear the cushion with amalgam costing
sixpence an ounce, an ounce lasting for many weeks. It usually consists of five
parts of zinc mixed with three parts of tin, and gradually mixed with nine parts of
mercury, but an amalgam can be easily made by melting in a tobacco-pipe a piece
of zinc about as large as a pea, and adding to it an ounce of mercury, stirring the
mixture thoroughly and pouring it on the hearth to cool. If you have a silk flap
over the cushion, smear the amalgam on to the cushion as evenly as you can
manage; if you have a leather flap with silk top, spread the amalgam along the
leather in a strip of about half an inch in width, which you have previously slightly
greased with a tallow candle. To apply the amalgam you will have to unscrew the
cushion from the stand.</p>

<p>When you have replaced the cushion and are ready to start, put the machine
down to the fire to warm. Do not put it too near, or it may crack. The machine
must be free from dust, so clean it well with a silk handkerchief; and it must be
dry, more especially the cylinder where it is not covered with the flap and the glass
support of the prime conductor. Unless these are free from damp the machine will
not work. Do not turn the handle of the machine until you are assured that the
cylinder is dry; by doing so you give the rubber the benefit of the whole circumference
of moisture, and it may take you some time to get rid of the wet. If you
ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
have a plate machine, remember this most particularly, for your brushes will be
made quite useless for a time by such thoughtlessness. And one other word of
caution with regard to plate machines, and that is, never place them sideways to the
fire, always dry them end on. The thicker the glass the easier it splits with
inequalities of temperature.</p>

<p>All being dry and warm, clamp the machine to a table and turn the handle. If
you have carefully followed these instructions, your knuckle will receive a spark as
soon as you apply it to the ball of the prime conductor; and the handle of the
machine will turn more stiffly as you progress. If your cylinder becomes too greasy,
wipe it clean and apply a little more amalgam. If it does not work quite right at
first, see that some pointed thing on the table is not drawing the electricity away;
even a hair will affect the working, so keep a good look-out for fragments of cotton
and fluff. When you get the sparks bring your jar into play, charging by simply
holding it out with its knob touching, or close to the knob of the prime conductor.</p>

<p>The essentials of the cylinder machine are that it should be made of hard dry
wood and of glass without an excess of alkali, that its workmanship should be firm
and true, that it should have no unnecessary points and edges, and that it should be
only used when free from damp. Those who are interested in the subject, and wish
to see what a well-made machine is like, should visit the Science Collection at the
South Kensington Museum. There is there, among other noticeable things, a plate
machine seven feet in diameter. The exhibition is one of the best in London, and
it is most easily got at from the Queen&#8217;s Gate side, the entrance being the door
nearest the private houses on the way up to the gardens from the railway station.
It is open free on the usual South Kensington days&mdash;Monday, Tuesday, and
Saturday.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LIV.&mdash;A STORM IN A TEACUP.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Electrical machines are not always as persistently popular as they might be,
owing to their possessors being at a loss for novel experiments. The apparatus
is put through its facings like soldiers at drill, the bells are rung, the little men
are danced up and down between the plates, the lady&#8217;s hair is stiffened like quills
upon the maligned porcupine, the sparks are extracted on the glass stool, a few
shocks are given, and the round ends in a certain weariness, to be repeated at
ever-lengthening intervals. The apparatus is always the same, the experiments are
the same, and to a good many boys the constant repetition becomes monotonous.
Some, of course, take sufficient interest in the matter to master the theory of the
experiments and gain a living pleasure in what they do; the majority, less sturdily
endowed, require to be led more gently on and have their paths made smoother.
All, however, are invariably interested in using their hands as well as their heads,
and for their benefit we offer the following hints, and relate how we last raised our
storm in a teacup.</p>

<p>We took two pieces of glass tube and laid them side by side on a cup. The
tubes had been bought for threepence from the druggist&#8217;s across the street, and
had been used as peashooters, for which they are most excellently adapted.
They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
are true, smooth, and to the ordinary tin peashooter very much what the modern
rifle is to the old brown Bess. They carry a pea&mdash;but it suddenly occurs to us
that we ought not to have said anything about such objectionable practices, which
of course took place a good many years ago, as witness the &#8216;had been used&#8217; with
which the digression was introduced.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo444.jpg" alt="teacup" width="300" height="403" title="To Jar
To Jar." />
</div>

<p>The pieces of glass tubing were then thoroughly dried and laid on the cup
side by side. Over each of them a piece of tinfoil was pinched to represent the
storm-clouds, and in one of the corners of
each cloud, in order to make things easy
for the electricity, we squeezed in a brass
ball. To each cloud we attached a piece
of silk twist out of the workbox, and then,
by means of some copper wire&mdash;brass
chain would have done just as well&mdash;we
connected one cloud with the inside and
one with the outside of a laden Leyden
jar, or jar charged from the machine,
whichever word-combination may appear
preferable. We then proceeded to pull
the silken strings, the tinfoil clouds slipped
along their glassy ways, approached each
other slowly, and then&mdash;a flash of lightning
passed from each to each, and the
thunder rolled in the form of the tiny snap
which sounded as the discharge took place.</p>

<p>The theory of the thunderstorm suddenly
awoke new interest in us, and having
succeeded so well in the air, we resolved
to advance further and do some damage.
We took away one of the tubes, and
resting the other on two cups&mdash;one at each
end&mdash;placed a model house between for us to strike. The house was very loosely
put together, the walls being only leant up against each other, and so arranged as to
fall at the slightest jerk. In the chimney we placed a brass ball for the electricity to
gather on instead of streaming off into the air, as it does on an ordinary lightning-conductor,
and then, having joined up to the jar, we brought the cloud over and
got our flash as we had hoped.</p>

<p>Then we soared to higher flights and put a pinch of gunpowder in the way of
the flash, in the hope that we should have a little blow up, but, alas! the flash
went through so quickly that the powder was scattered. Then we remembered the
wet string with which our lecturer used to operate, and placing that in the path
of the current, we slowed the rate, kept the flash in the powder long enough to
ignite it, and blew down the walls of our house in grand style.</p>

<p>Then we worked up to our crowning success in the experiment line. We had
a small model of a ship, and we resolved to strike it by lightning. We hung our
cloud over a basin. Into the basin we put our ship, having first connected
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
foremast with our jar, and placed the least pinch of powder in a hole, where it
entered the deck. The jar was charged, the cloud hung in the sky, the ship
came &#8216;sailing, sailing o&#8217;er the sea;&#8217; it neared the storm; it passed into it; it came
within striking distance; there was a flash, a crack, and &#8216;the saucy frigate floated
on the bosom of the waves&#8217;&mdash;in the wash-hand basin&mdash;&#8216;a helpless wreck.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What was the use of all that?&#8217; Well, the use was that we clearly understood
what before we had half doubted because we had only taken it for granted. We
left off talking about the &#8216;electric fluid&#8217; and &#8216;thunderbolts;&#8217; we no longer looked
upon electricity as something liquid which dropped out of a cloud with a bang;
we ceased to imagine that lightning-conductors should be <i>insulated</i>, &#8216;to lead the
fluid.&#8217; And we saw that the &#8216;stroke&#8217; went up from the earth as well as down
from the sky; that the flash took place at the meeting, and was simply due to
the necessary transference in attaining equilibrium.</p>

<p>A good deal of the success of the experiment was due to the size of the jar,
the quantity of electricity it accumulated being proportionate to the extent of the
coated surface; while the intensity depended on the thickness of the glass. Ours
was a fair-sized jar, but its strength was nothing like that of Cuthbertson&#8217;s famous
battery, which he built for the Tylerian Society at Haarlem, which consisted of a
hundred jars each of five and a half square feet, so that the total amount of coated
surface was five hundred and fifty square feet, sufficient to magnetise large steel
bars, rend four-inch blocks of boxwood in pieces, melt into red-hot globules iron
wires twenty-five feet long, and dissipate eight-inch tin wires in a cloud of smoke.
Of course with an ordinary battery we could have done as well, but even with
frictional electricity distance is of little importance. Did not Bishop Watson, of
Llandaff, send a discharge from a Leyden jar through 2,800 feet of wire and the
same distance of earth? Did he not, at Shooter&#8217;s Hill, send a discharge through
10,600 feet of wire supported on insulators of baked wood? Did not Franklin, in
1748, send a Leyden jar discharge across the Schuylkill? and did not De Luc
discharge a jar across the whole width of the Lake of Geneva? We may not be
Watsons, Franklins, or De Lucs, and have their wealth of apparatus and dexterity
of manipulation, but the poorest and clumsiest lad amongst us is quite capable of
arranging the necessary device for securing &#8216;a storm in a teacup.&#8217;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LV.&mdash;MYSTERY AND MUMMERY; OR, HOUDIN AND
THE ARABS.<br />
<span class="smcap">By John Nevil Maskelyne, of the Egyptian Hall.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">The famous French conjurer, Robert Houdin, was engaged by the French
Government in 1856 to proceed to Algiers, and there demonstrate to the natives that
the Marabouts, whom the ignorant Arabs believed to possess supernatural powers,
were only very clumsy tricksters. Never had conjurer a higher mission than this&mdash;to
erase a debasing superstition from the minds of these children of the desert!</p>

<p>At the Algiers theatre were assembled all the leading chiefs and a large
audience of minor natives. Houdin, skilled in all the sleight-of-hand, the scientific
knowledge, and the <i>finesse</i> of the French school of magicians, was equal to any
emergency. He was as cool and collected as on his own stage at Paris, and
addressed his strange audience in a few well-chosen words, which were translated to
the Arabs by interpreters provided by the French Government of the town.</p>

<p>In this little speech he told the natives that his art was simply the outcome of
science and dexterity: that if his feats excelled those of the Marabouts, his
audience could judge for themselves whether they had not been the victims of
imposture for many years at the hands of very clumsy jugglers indeed; and that in
the end he hoped to leave those poor wizards without a leg to stand on&mdash;professionally
of course!</p>

<p>The conjurer commenced his performance with a few ordinary sleight-of-hand
tricks sufficiently puzzling to create great wonder in the native mind, and then
proceeded to bolder and more ambitious efforts. Carrying a small box down to
the &#8216;practicable&#8217; or &#8216;rake,&#8217; running from the stage to the pit, he declared that
though a little child might lift it, he could defy the strongest man in that assembly
to do so if he willed otherwise. This being interpreted, an Arab of middle height,
but well built and muscular, ventured to the test.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you very strong?&#8217; asked Houdin.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, yes,&#8217; replied the son of the desert, carelessly, not heeding the Frankish
magician&#8217;s assertion that he could deprive him of his strength.</p>

<p>Houdin allowed the man to pick up the box easily, as if it were a toy, and
return it to the &#8216;rake,&#8217; smiling to think that <i>he</i> could be made as a little child.
But Houdin now made some mystic passes over the box, and requested the dusky
Hercules to raise it once more. He tried; but tug and strain as he would, the
box was immoveable. He stopped at length, panting, and was on the point of
leaving his task, when pride overcame a desire to escape from this enchantment,
and he made one final effort, cheered by his compatriots in front. All in vain: and
just as he was on the point of giving in once more, he sank, with a terrible yell,
upon his knees.</p>

<p>The reason of this was that the conjurer had given a signal, and the poor
man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
had received the shock of an electrical current, transmitted to the handles of the
box. By similar means had the box been held to the stage when the conjurer
willed it, for a bar of soft iron underneath the &#8216;rake&#8217; was converted into a magnet
by passing an electrical current in coils round it. When the current was suspended
by Houdin&#8217;s assistant behind the scenes, the bar was demagnetised, and the box
could be lifted up. Of course this was a mystery to the natives, and as the beaten
Arab retired, murmurs of &#8216;Shaitan&#8217; and &#8216;Djenoum&#8217; running round the startled
audience told that, notwithstanding the assurances of the interpreters, the
natives gave Houdin credit for having dealings with one who shall here be
nameless.</p>

<p>The skilful professor had been informed that the most startling of the supposed
miracles of the Marabouts was their standing in front of a loaded gun, which,
though pointed at them and the trigger pulled, producing sparks in plenty from the
flint, would yet not go off. The cabalistic jargon of the Marabout was supposed to
place his sacred person in safety; and this was one of the tricks the French
Government was anxious to prove an imposture.</p>

<p>Houdin, though the guns would not go off, soon exploded the marvel. He saw
at once that the mystery was of the simplest, the Marabout merely stopping up the
vent of the firearm with grease while handing it to the experimentalist. Accordingly
this was the next feat Houdin called the attention of his audience to,
declaring himself invulnerable (by trickery alone), and defying even the &#8216;crack
shot&#8217; of the district to hit him.</p>

<p>An Arab, delighted to have a human target, bounded upon the stage with the
words, &#8216;I will kill you!&#8217; This was a Marabout jealous of a sorcerer greater than
himself. Houdin gave him a cavalry pistol to examine. The man blew down the
barrel and into the nipple, and then loaded it with powder and ball. To add to
his other precautions, he had previously <i>marked</i> the bullet.</p>

<p>The French <i>prestidigitateur</i> placed an apple upon the point of a knife, and holding
it up, said, &#8216;Aim straight at my heart!&#8217; Though the Arab firmly believed the
weapon to be really deadly, he took careful aim and fired point blank at Houdin.
There was a pause. The conjurer fell not, but calmly advanced to the man, and
presented him with the apple, in the heart of which the marked bullet was found,
instead of in Houdin&#8217;s.</p>

<p>You see, the Frenchman had dexterously changed the marked bullet for a
similar one in appearance, but composed of an amalgam of tinfoil and quicksilver,
which is about the same weight as lead, and disperses on the firing. Into a hole
previously made in the apple, on the side kept from the view of the audience,
Houdin dropped the marked ball before placing the fruit upon his knife, and had
closed the aperture with a round piece of apple afterwards, just as a cheesemonger
makes his Stilton whole again after you have tasted from his scoop. When the
apple was cut open, and the bullet fell out, attention was at once directed to the
marks upon it, and, of course, so drawn from any scrutiny of the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the ball
that had been fired from the pistol.</p>

<p>Houdin&#8217;s powers were put to another test subsequently to his public
performance. A deputation of the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of Algiers and its neighbourhood waited
upon him, headed by Bash-aga Bou-Allem, the African Rothschild, to still
further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
test the gun-trick. Houdin was prepared. From beneath his snowy-white <i>burnous</i>
an aged Arab produced two richly-chased pistols. These the Frankish conjurer
loaded, previously handing round the bullets for inspection. Then he passed one
pistol to the chief, who, at six paces, fired, and the ball was apparently caught
between Houdin&#8217;s teeth. Dropping this from his mouth to prove its solidity,
Houdin now took up the other pistol and fired at the stone wall of the apartment,
when&mdash;great wonder to the chiefs, and dismay to the impostors&mdash;the bullet
apparently drew blood from the stone. One of the defeated Marabouts actually
put his finger on the blood and tasted it; then he collapsed.</p>

<p>This trick was &#8216;worked up&#8217; very cleverly by Houdin. He &#8216;palmed&#8217; both
the real bullets, substituting one made of wax (hollow) and lampblack for the pistol
he gave to the Arab, and crushing it as he rammed the charge home, so that it
would not injure him at such short distance. The pistol he used himself had a
hollow leaden ball dropped into it, and the cavity in the bullet was filled in with
blood, so that when the lead was crushed against the wall the interior contents were
splashed upon it.</p>

<p>Houdin was the finest political agent the French Government ever sent out,
and the most civilising withal; for the clumsy tricks of the Marabouts, which he
exposed, had very little effect upon any but the very lowest class afterwards.</p>

<p>Gun and pistol tricks are so much a part of the conjurer&#8217;s art that it may be
well to describe some others, to show the ingenuity of these whilom &#8216;diverting
vagabonds&#8217;&mdash;the wizards&mdash;who are now frequently to be found in very good
company indeed.</p>

<p>One of the old gun-tricks was somewhat like Houdin&#8217;s device for nonplussing
the Arab impostors. In this a fowling-piece was used, and loaded by any one in the
company, the professor of mystery only taking the liberty of placing the ball&mdash;previously
examined to prove its genuineness&mdash;into the barrel himself. Of course
that real ball never went out of the magician&#8217;s possession, but a duplicate composed
of blacklead was substituted for it, which could be readily reduced to powder by a
vigorous ramming home of the charge, and so rendered harmless.</p>

<p>But modern magic goes far beyond so simple a trick, and has elaborated this
kind of business until some apparently marvellous results are achieved.</p>

<p>To explain these it will be necessary, in the first place, to notice the peculiar
construction of the wizard&#8217;s firearm. This consists of two parts, the outer of which
is a conical tin funnel like the mouth of a trumpet, and tapering down to a tube,
which fits the barrel of an ordinary pistol. This tube runs inside the cone, and
affords a free passage for the loading and discharge of the pistol, and between the
tube and the outer case any object supposed to be fired therefrom reposes in
perfect security. Sometimes the performer borrows two or three watches and
places them in a drawer, while he sends his assistant for a plate. To this the
watches are transferred, and as the youth advances to the conjurer&#8217;s table, he
purposely slips and falls, when the plate is smashed, and the watches roll all over
the stage. The wizard makes much ado in rebuking this clumsiness, and picks up
the fragments of delf and the watches, all of which he finds more or less injured.
Never mind; he will soon find a way out of <i>that</i> difficulty, he says, so he proceeds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>to load
the pistol and ram all the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the (not silver) plate and the timekeepers
into it, keeping them firm in their places with a wad of paper. Now the
(supposed) clumsy assistant places a picture frame on the stage, at which the
magician takes aim and fires, and at the same instant the plate and watches are
seen in the frame (which up to this time apparently rejoiced in a plain black backboard
only), all perfect save the plate. This appears with a piece out of it, and the
conjurer seems chagrined that he has made a mistake, especially before his unskilful
assistant. Looking about the stage he finds the missing piece, and is again
equal to the occasion. Standing some distance from the frame, he appears to throw
the piece he has found at the &#8216;willow pattern&#8217; whose other component parts have
been so unaccountably welded together. Lo! as the fragment seems to leave his
opened palm the plate, whole as when it left the potter&#8217;s hands, is ready to be
examined by the audience: and the watches, ticking as lively as ever, are restored to
the pockets of their respective owners quite unscathed, notwithstanding the fearful
trials they seemed to have passed through.</p>

<p>The explanation of this is simplicity itself. When the watches have been
collected by the professor they are placed in what appears to be an ordinary
drawer, but which is in reality a tricky arrangement that can be made to appear full
or empty at pleasure. The conjurer has, of course, shown an empty drawer, but
this has a false bottom wherein lie several &#8216;dummy&#8217; watches, and it is these that
are transferred to the plate and afterwards rammed into the pistol. The real
watches are carried off the stage by the skilfully-clumsy assistant and attached to
the frame (in a manner yet to be described), together with a duplicate of the broken
plate before it is introduced to the view of the audience.</p>

<p>This picture-frame is a marvel of deception. Notwithstanding that it appears as
if it possessed a plain black backboard only, it is in reality a shallow box, with a
spring blind in front of it. Behind this screen the articles are suspended, on a
background also black. When the professor fires, the assistant (out of sight) pulls a
cord releasing a spring, and the curtain flies up with such rapidity as to be
imperceptible from the point of view of the audience. The &#8216;click&#8217; of the curtain
is unheard in the noise made by the pistol, and the effect is as if the watches and
plate had been fired from it.</p>

<p>But we have yet to explain how the broken plate is made whole. Our readers
will have guessed, probably, that it never was broken at all, and such is the fact.
A piece of black cloth lies over one edge of the plate, which makes it appear as if
it is broken, and as the magician seems to throw (though he really retains) a piece
of the plate actually smashed, the assistant again pulls a string smartly, which is
attached to the bit of black cloth, and the plate instantly appears in a perfect state
of preservation. That is more than can be said for the contents of all picture-frames
after they have been &#8216;restored.&#8217; Of course these tricks cannot be performed
when an audience is very close to the wizard. &#8216;&#8217;Tis distance lends
enchantment&#8217; to many things in the conjurer&#8217;s art, as in others outside.</p>

<p>Sometimes this trick is &#8216;worked&#8217; in other ways; say, after a borrowed watch
has (apparently) been pounded to bits in a mortar, it is fired from a pistol at a
magic target. In this there is no roller-blind illusion, but the &#8216;bull&#8217;s-eye,&#8217; provided
with a little hook (hook and eye should go together), revolves perpendicularly on
its own axis. The back of the bull&#8217;s-eye is precisely similar to the front, but on
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
hook there the real watch is secretly hung. When the pistol is fired, the pulling of
a string releases a spring, and the centre of the target flies round. The mortar
employed has a movable bottom, so that the performer can extract the real watch
at pleasure. The <i>d&eacute;bris</i> which the conjurer pounds away at, and afterwards loads
his trick pistol with, is obtained from the hollow pestle, the performer unscrewing
the end of it against the bottom of the mortar as he appears to grind away at the
borrowed watch.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LVI.&mdash;VENTRILOQUISM, AND HOW TO ACQUIRE
THE ART.<br />
<span class="smcap">By William Crompton.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">The etymology of the word Ventriloquism gives an incorrect idea of the art, as
it is based upon the old notion that the ventriloquial voice really proceeded from
the stomach. As a matter of fact, the sources of all such sounds are in the throat
or mouth.</p>

<p>By the aid of the laryngoscope, a scientific instrument mirroring the action and
vibrating changes of the vocal organ, it has been shown that tone and voice come
when the cords in the larynx are excited by the breath; but a muffled vibration
in the cavity of the mouth, which is caused by the action of the tongue and lips,
produces <i>whispering</i>, in which the words appear as from a distance, and, thus
robbed of their distinct vocal sounds, can be produced with little or no movement
of the muscles of the face.</p>

<p>But the ventriloquist knows full well that the judgment must be led astray
quite as much as the ear; therefore, in disguising the true direction of his voice&mdash;or
those assumed voices which he has added to his own&mdash;he requires <i>finesse</i> of a high
order, which, while he shall be apparently unconscious of doing so, must lead his
audience to certain conclusions respecting the situation of the sounds. In this
he is greatly assisted by Nature, which lays the foundation of the art in the fact
of the uncertainty of their <i>direction</i> as well as <i>distance</i>.</p>

<p>It was formerly common on the Continent for performers on the stage to go
through the dumb show of singing while persons off the stage supplied the voices.
The same uncertainty as to the direction of sound is manifested at a marionette
show, where the actors&mdash;wooden dolls&mdash;&#8216;strut and fret their hour upon the stage,&#8217;
their actions leading the spectators to ally the speeches with them, and to look
upon the manikins almost as veritable human beings. The illusion, if properly
carried out, is very perfect.</p>

<p>One of the most favourite modes of ventriloquists now and for a long
time past has been to have two or more wooden
figures with jaws moved by strings acted upon by
the hands of the performer, or by pedals. The
artist then holds converse between these, and so
takes attention from his own movements. Another
capital device is the &#8216;Talking Hand,&#8217; which it may
be here well to describe. Having first provided
yourself with a mitten purposely made, with a hole in
the centre, and a frill round it, thus<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLVI01">
<img src="images/illo454.jpg" alt="mitten" width="350" height="255" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">and painted the side of your hand to
represent Biddy the apple-woman&#8217;s face, so:</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLVI02">
<img src="images/illo455a.jpg" alt="Biddy" width="350" height="286" />
</div>

<p class="noindent">you are ready to make a nice little speech,
and introduce &#8216;Biddy&#8217; to your expectant
audience in the back parlour.</p>

<p>Indian ink will give her eyes as black
as Susan&#8217;s, and a little red paint, judiciously
applied to the top of the thumb
and that part of the hand immediately above
it, will materially assist the illusion by giving
her a mouth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLVI03">
<img src="images/illo455b.jpg" alt="Biddy" width="350" height="226" />
</div>

<p>The <a href="#FigLVI03">annexed</a> is a picture of Biddy with
her new cap on. Her nose must be indicated
by black lines, and a slight redness
at the uptilted end may not be considered out
of character. The chin, you observe, is painted
on the thumb.</p>

<p>Now stitch a skirt to the lower part of the
mitten, and throw a shawl round her head, and
you have the old apple-woman to the life.</p>

<p>You must arrange a little dialogue between
Biddy and yourself, keeping the imaginations of
the spectators in full play, so as to draw attention
from your lips and muscles, which you must nevertheless keep in as much rest
as possible. Let Biddy&#8217;s sentences be short and emphatic, and in a tone as
unlike your natural voice as you can assume. As Biddy speaks you must move
your thumb up and down, which motion can be so made as to give the idea of the
lips moving.</p>

<p>How the <i>imagination</i> can be led astray even without motions at all may be
instanced in the case of the imitations of Saville Carey, who often blew through
a narrow chink in the corner of a coffee-room with an east-wind like whistle,
whereupon the company began to shiver with cold, and some one was sure to
rise and examine the windows to see if they were air-tight!</p>

<p>Starting, then, with these peculiarities of Nature on his side (that the direction
and distance of sound are difficult to fix, and that the imagination is easily played
upon), the ventriloquist, by tricks of manner, with subtle movements and actions,
governs the imagination of his audience, and directs their attention to some
given spot from which he desires they should think the voice proceeds, while
simultaneously imitating it as closely as possible.</p>

<p>The ventriloquial power any one with a fair range of voice and patient practice
may acquire. The rarer gift is that of mimicry, by which the illusions of change
of tone, pitch, etc., are so greatly assisted. Unless endowed with this in some
degree one would find the pursuit of the art a vain and profitless task, but a little
will sometimes go a long way, and a careful noting of the modes of some good
professors of ventriloquism will give many useful hints to the neophyte, after he
has got &#8216;by heart&#8217; all that has been written upon the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span></p>

<p>He will notice that the jaws need never be moved, and that though the lips
must be in action at times, the effect is neutralised by dexterously turning the
side face to the spectators on those occasions. This standing in profile has another
advantage also, as the lips can be drawn down on the hidden side, and a considerable
alteration in the tone can thus be produced where required.</p>

<p>The vowel sounds, in various tones, may be obtained without movement by
nearly closing the mouth, and resting the upper teeth on the inner part of the
upper lips. Consonants are much more difficult, and are seldom or never used
while facing the audience. When there is no excuse for turning the face sideways
the expedient is adopted of dropping the consonants, which would make such a
sentence as, &#8216;Mind what you are doing, you bad boy!&#8217; sound like &#8216;Ind &#8216;ot you&#8217;re
doing, you &#8216;ad whoy!&#8217;</p>

<p>The greater the compass of voice, of course the greater will be the pitch, while
practice will produce elasticity in the organs. One word of advice is necessary
as to practice&mdash;that is, you should <i>never strain the voice</i>. Let the power be
developed naturally, or you will inevitably defeat your own object and lead to
hoarseness, if no worse.</p>

<p>Study before a mirror. Any illusions you can there produce will be greater in
effect when distance lends enchantment to the view, for the ventriloquist&#8217;s art
cannot be practised with full effect in a very limited area.</p>

<p>An accurate ear will soon enable its possessor to imitate sounds, such as the
barking of dogs, sawing wood, etc., but his difficulties will commence when he comes
to attempt complete and rapid changes of voice, locality, and distance. From
youth to age, from the infant in its nurse&#8217;s arms to the &#8216;lean and slippered
pantaloon,&#8217; the transition must be like a flash of lightning in rapidity. Dialects
should also be acquired, and varieties of age and sex carefully studied.</p>

<p>It is after the human voice has been imitated without any apparent motion
of the lips, and conversations with imaginary individuals have been carefully
studied, that the higher power of the ventriloquist comes into play, and the
performer has to lead the imagination of his audience from the real to the supposed
source of the sounds. This is what, in acoustic illusions, is as necessary as glib
speech (&#8216;patter&#8217;) to the conjurer, who, by thus calling attention from his hands, is
enabled to perform many tricks successfully which he might otherwise fail in. We
have said that our judgments are very fallible in the matter of sound, and the
performer&#8217;s efforts towards indicating their supposed direction is, to a great extent,
the measure of his capacity as a ventriloquist.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER LVII.&mdash;SECOND SIGHT.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Second sight, as it is called, is of a very puzzling character indeed. To such an
extent is this the case that some clever people have been led to believe that a
special gift&mdash;some abnormal power&mdash;must be brought into play to bring about its
apparently marvellous results. The writer hopes, before the boys who read this
have got to the end, that they may have a much clearer idea of the ingenious and,
if rightly applied, innocent trickery than such persons seem to possess.</p>

<p>The word &#8216;abnormal&#8217; has been mentioned, and it is almost applicable to the
title of this chapter, as the memory must be developed beyond its ordinary tension
by constant practice to give that ease and quickness without which second sight, or
&#8216;clairvoyance,&#8217; is but a sorry exhibition.
It is wonderful, however (as all matters
relating to our organisation are), what
little spur memory needs to meet any
strain put upon it. Generally, &#8216;Where
there&#8217;s a will there&#8217;s a way.&#8217;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo457.jpg" alt="clairvoyante" width="350" height="346" />
</div>

<p>This exceedingly clever and subtle
mode of conveying by words or letters
what is in the mind of one person to the
comprehension of another is not an invention
of yesterday, though it has now
attained to great perfection. It was introduced
into England by the Italian conjurer
Pinetti at the Haymarket Theatre
in the year 1784. He announced that
Signora Pinetti, seated in one of the front
boxes with a handkerchief over her eyes,
would &#8216;guess&#8217; at everything imagined or
proposed to her by the audience. The clever French magician, Robert Houdin,
took up the trick, and &#8216;worked&#8217; it with his son; and our own Scotch &#8216;professor,&#8217;
Anderson, followed in his wake, the &#8216;Wizard of the North&#8217;s&#8217; daughter being the
clairvoyante in this case. Robert Heller was also a capital exponent of second sight,
with the assistance of his sister; and the Taylors, father and son, a few years ago
astonished the lieges with their most befogging entertainment at the Polytechnic.
Then M. Heriott and &#8216;Little Louie&#8217; were perhaps the most noted in this peculiar
line of business, the latter phenomenon startling even those who understood the
system by her marvellous aptitude, and the precocity that could cram such a mass
of intricate knowledge into so small a head.</p>

<p>We have stated that clairvoyance lies between two persons. These are, first,
the interlocutor, <i>who sees the articles</i> hereafter to be described by the person in
collusion with him; and, secondly, the latter gifted being, who, with eyes
bandaged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
can yet grasp mentally, through the medium of the questions put, the nature of the
answers to be given. Of course, all eyes are attracted to the clairvoyante, and all
attention deliberately turned thereto, though the most difficult position is really
occupied by the one asking the questions, he having to decide instantly as to his
choice of words, and put them in such a natural, unstudied, and off-hand style&mdash;and
so quickly withal&mdash;as to effectually <i>nonplus</i> those unlearned in the art and
mystery.</p>

<p>Most public performers work with a code of their own, merely taking the idea, or
ground-work, which past professors have laid down; and they elaborate and add
to their word signals from day to day as the necessities of their position are thrust
upon them. The best way, also, for any &#8216;going in&#8217; for this fascinating bit of
innocent deception is to adopt the same course, and when their code is, as nearly
as they can imagine, perfect, to study and practise diligently, and make sure they
are sufficiently &#8216;well-up&#8217; and <i>glib</i> in their respective parts, so as to guard against
being made a laughing-stock, and exposing the method at the same time. The
interlocutor should be able to put the questions without hesitation or mistake (as,
in the latter case, he runs the clairvoyante off the rails also), and with such <i>nonchalance</i>
as to put the spectators off their guard.</p>

<p>Memory, of course, plays an important part in the matter, but not quite to the
extent one might at first imagine. One hundred signals would exhaust the list of
ordinary articles carried about the person; and a system of <i>grouping</i>&mdash;to be explained
hereafter&mdash;will simplify the code, and yet more effectually mystify an
audience, as presenting less variety in the questions put. After you have a large
collection of miscellaneous articles coded (and you can never have <i>too</i> many, if well
chosen), numbers&mdash;signalled by means of letters, not words&mdash;and an <i>alphabet</i> for
the spelling of surnames, etc., will require great attention; but patience and perseverance
will surmount all obstacles, and without these you had better not attempt
second-sight at all.</p>

<p>As we have said, most persons who &#8216;go in&#8217; for public clairvoyance compile a
code of their own, and hence, after giving what we consider the best under the
circumstances, we shall mention those of two public performers, who have given to
the world their systems, one through the pages of a leading American magazine
(<i>Scribner&#8217;s</i>), the other written by Mr. Washington Irving Bishop, who published a
book on Second Sight, containing a <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of his own professional signals; and
as both of these differ from the following, and from each other in most important
respects, they will be treated separately, so that the reader may elect which system
to pursue before entering upon the (at first toilsome, but afterwards pleasant) path
of laws.</p>

<p>We will now proceed to give examples of an easy code for miscellaneous
articles: following which we will have a system of grouping, a code for numbers,
and an alphabet; and we shall conclude with the application of all these.</p>

<p>In the miscellaneous articles let us understand that &#8216;Tell&#8217; indicates articles of
attire; &#8216;What,&#8217; those taken from the pockets; &#8216;Do,&#8217; those carried in the hands;
&#8216;Can&#8217; and &#8216;Will,&#8217; jewellery, and other articles of adornment; and &#8216;Anything,&#8217;
various articles not enumerated in the foregoing.</p>

<p>Christian names, towns, animals, fishes, shape, etc., can also be arranged in the

<p>The next process, after committing such grouped subjects to memory, is to
study a code for numbers, which you will easily acquire in one lesson, the only
difficulty you will find being in the rapid application of it. The numbers will be
represented by letters thus<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>If one figure only is required the interlocutor will ask for the <i>figure</i>; if two
figures he will ask for the <i>number</i>; if three he will precede his question with &#8216;good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>&#8217;
and the clairvoyant will know that he has entered into hundreds. If there are four
figures he will say, &#8216;Very good,&#8217; and that will indicate thousands; if five, &#8216;Very
good, sir,&#8217; or &#8216;madam,&#8217; equivalent to tens of thousands. For six figures &#8216;good
again,&#8217; hundreds of thousands; and &#8216;If you please&#8217; will act as a full stop. Example:
&#8216;Tell me now, if you please, what figures there are here?&#8217;&mdash;<i>t m n</i> (132) precede the
full stop of &#8216;If you please,&#8217; and the interlocutor has dropped the &#8216;good,&#8217; which
would have warned the clairvoyant that three figures had to be deciphered. Again,
&#8216;There are figures here. Very good. Find the numbers, can you?&#8217; &#8216;Yes,&#8217; says
the clairvoyant, taking the first four initial letters after &#8216;Very good;&#8217; &#8216;eight thousand
one hundred and twenty-seven;&#8217; and great is the marvel of the audience thereat.</p>

<p>The last and most difficult problem of all appertaining to our subject&mdash;though,
luckily, the most easily dispensed with for private performance&mdash;is the abstruse
<i>Alphabet</i>, by which the clairvoyant may learn the name of a person or gain other
particulars in a way quite unsuspected by the spectators. This is managed by
taking B to represent A, C to stand for B, and so on, always being one letter in
advance of the ordinary alphabet, save in the variations noted below. Thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="column2">


<div class="column2l15">

<ul class="magic">
<li>A in the code will be B</li>
<li>B in the code will be C</li>
<li>C in the code will be D</li>

<li>E in the code will be F</li>

<li>X in the code will be Easy.</li>
<li>Y in the code will be Very easy.</li>
<li>Z in the code will be Plain.</li>
</ul>

</div><!--column2r15-->

</div><!--column2-->

<p>To illustrate this, say the interlocutor has an address card with &#8216;William Brown&#8217;
printed upon it; he would first ask the Christian name by the grouping process,
and then, to get at the surname might say, &#8216;Come, speak plainly at once, if you
please, the gentleman&#8217;s name?&#8217; C S P A O is translated into BROWN by the
above system, and the answer is correct. This transposition of letters, as we have
said, is very difficult, but if once acquired, brings the reward of being eminently
puzzling with it.</p>

<p>In addition to all here set forth, the &#8216;cue&#8217; is frequently given to the clairvoyant in a
very simple manner as, &#8216;Is it large or small?&#8217; &#8216;It is small.&#8217; &#8216;Plain, or with stones?&#8217;
&#8216;There are stones in it.&#8217; &#8216;Is it gold?&#8217; &#8216;No; only gilt.&#8217; &#8216;Does this belong to a
gentleman or a lady?&#8217; &#8216;To a lady.&#8217; Besides this, intonations, dwellings upon
certain words, a hesitating cough, or an apparently chance remark let fall to one of
the audience, conveys much to the initiated, and allows of that variation which is so
necessary in public exhibitions to prevent persons getting at the secret. One very
old and extremely useful form of question&mdash;generally used at the close of an entertainment&mdash;is
the <i>Sequence</i>, the interlocutor touching various articles worn or held
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
his immediate neighbourhood, and rapidly receiving replies from the clairvoyant,
though his questions are of the simplest. This is done by numbering a set of such
general articles as are sure to be met with. Thus, if it is wet weather, overcoats and
umbrellas will be plentiful; if fine, sticks, parasols, and fans will be in the ascendant.
Let three or four codes be arranged for these, so as to vary the sequence and avoid
detection, thus<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="column2">

</ul>

</div><!--column2-->

<p>At a drawing-room entertainment such articles as we have here provided for
would be quite out of place, as your visitors are not likely to carry their cloaks, hats,
canes, or even opera-glasses with them. In such cases you can arrange with your
clairvoyant five minutes before performance in what sequence you will take the
more prominent articles on or about those &#8216;in front.&#8217;</p>

<p>A &#8216;head&#8217; is chosen as the <i>finale</i>, so as to bring the curtain down with <i>&eacute;clat</i>, as the
interlocutor can ask, &#8216;How many hairs are there on it?&#8217; and the ready answer of,
say, &#8216;Three thousand five hundred and sixty-five,&#8217; will cause a hearty laugh.
Besides this, all through the &#8216;business&#8217; the person who interrogates will endeavour
to amuse as well as to mystify his audience, to which end what is professionally
known as his &#8216;patter&#8217; (talk) is interlarded with &#8216;wheezes&#8217; (jokes), and seemingly
impromptu wit often of the most studied and built-up character. Some public performers
also employ confederates, who lend an added wonder by producing very
curious and out-of-the-way documents or other things, all of which, having been carefully
studied beforehand, the clairvoyant can give full particulars of. The practice
is, however, reprehensible; the art is sufficiently puzzling without such adventitious
aids, and the secret is sure to leak out, when those who have been unable to fathom
the business will jump to the conclusion that much more is due to confederacy than
has really been the case.</p>

<p>Having gone through the drudgery, the hard study necessary to the full comprehension
of the art, we now reach a stage when it may be put into practice, and can
do nothing better than give an imaginary performance to show the application of
the principles previously laid down.</p>

<p>A nice little speech will introduce yourself and confederate, the usual way being
to modestly disclaim the supernatural for the wonders you are about to work.
Suppose your assistant to be a young lady, she is blindfolded, and you proceed
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
business by requesting assistance from the spectators by the loan of any article they
would wish to be described by your clairvoyante.</p>

<p>Then you go to work at once<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Will you name this?&mdash;It is a ring.</p>

<p>Name the kind of ring?&mdash;It is a mourning ring.</p>

<p>Anything on it, please?&mdash;Yes, initials.</p>

<p>Be sure, if you please, and say what they are?&mdash;A. R.</p>

<p>Quite right. Can you tell this?&mdash;It is a watch.</p>

<p>Silver or gold?&mdash;Gold.</p>

<p>Anything on it?&mdash;Yes, there is a crest.</p>

<p>Quite correct. Now, the time, if you please, by it?&mdash;Twenty-one minutes
to one.</p>

<p>Very good. Can you name this?&mdash;Yes, it is a coin.</p>

<p>What coin?&mdash;A sixpence.</p>

<p>The date, if you please? (The clairvoyante knows it is of this century, as only
two letters are given.)&mdash;Eighteen hundred and eleven.</p>

<p>Can you tell this, please?&mdash;It is a medal.</p>

<p>Please name the metal?&mdash;Bronze.</p>

<p>Does she know? If you please to ask the young lady I have no doubt she will
tell you the campaign it is for, sir. (Here the interlocutor, in speaking to the owner
of medal, has given the cue to the clairvoyante by <i>d s k</i>, which stand for CRI.)
When the question is put, she says, &#8216;It is a Crimean medal.&#8217;</p>

<p>Now, there is an initial here; tell me that.&mdash;M.</p>

<p>Look now, if you please, at the number of the regiment.&mdash;The fifty-second.</p>

<p>Will you look here, please?&mdash;You now have a flower.</p>

<p>What flower?&mdash;Lily of the valley.</p>

<p>What name has this?&mdash;It is a cigarette.</p>

<p>What is here?&mdash;A pen-knife.</p>

<p>Now, how many blades are there?&mdash;Two.</p>

<p>Very easy. Pray view only here, if you please, and tell me the name engraved
upon the handle?&mdash;The name is <i>Young</i>.</p>

<p>What material is the handle made of?&mdash;Pearl.</p>

<p>What is this?&mdash;A pocket-book.</p>

<p>Anything here, please?&mdash;There is a letter inside.</p>

<p>Quite correct. If you please, tell me the initials of the person to whom it is
addressed?&mdash;P. B.</p>

<p>What is this, now?&mdash;A railway season ticket.</p>

<p>Can you tell the month it expires in?&mdash;Here the clairvoyante takes <i>c</i> for the
seventh month and answers &#8216;July.&#8217;</p>

<p>Very good. Be so kind, now, if you please, as to give us the number of it?&mdash;Nine
thousand and seventy-two.</p>

<p>Will you tell this, please?-It is a brooch.</p>

<p>Anything in it, please?&mdash;A child&#8217;s portrait.</p>

<p>Anything in it, now, at the back?&mdash;Yes, hair.</p>

<p>What colour is it?&mdash;Brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>

<p>What is this for?&mdash;To smoke. It is a cigar; you can have it.</p>

<p>Is that right, sir? Thank you! What kind of cigar is it?&mdash;A Manilla.</p>

<p>Do you know what this is for?&mdash;That would also suit you; it is a cane!</p>

<p>Thank you, miss, you are very kind! Tell this.&mdash;That is a hat.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>Can you tell the colour?&mdash;White.</p>

<p>And this?&mdash;A parasol.</p>

<p>Name the colour.&mdash;Blue.</p>

<p>Name the material of the handle, please.&mdash;Ivory.</p>

<p>And this?&mdash;That is a programme.</p>

<p>And this?&mdash;An opera-glass.</p>

<p>This?&mdash;A stick.</p>

<p>This?&mdash;A flower.</p>

<p>Do you know what flower?&mdash;Yes; a
camellia.</p>

<p>This?&mdash;An eye-glass.</p>

<p>This?&mdash;A breast-pin.</p>

<p>This?&mdash;A fan.</p>

<p>This?&mdash;A chain.</p>

<p>Find the carat?&mdash;The clairvoyante knows
that <i>f</i> stands for 8, and answers &#8216;Eighteen.&#8217;</p>

<p>This?&mdash;That is a glove.</p>

<p>Do you know the colour?&mdash;Black.</p>

<p>And this?&mdash;A head.</p>

<p>Anything in it?&mdash;No.</p>

<p>And so the curtain comes down with a
hearty laugh at the unfortunate wight whose
cranium is thus stigmatised as empty!</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Two other Systems.</span></h4>

<p>An &#8216;Ex-conjurer,&#8217; who has treated of The Secret of Second Sight in
<i>Scribner&#8217;s</i>, says he was inducted into its mysteries twenty years since by a Polish
Jew who claimed to have invented the system; or, at least, he had &#8216;treamed it&#8217;
(dreamed it), and that it was he who gave the code to Robert Heller. As to the
first of these statements, the inventing, or &#8216;treaming&#8217; it, we know that the Polish
Jew perverted the truth, &#8216;Clairvoyance&#8217; having been practised with success before
he was born: for the second, we shall find from a portion that has gone before and
some to follow that Heller&#8217;s code differed widely from &#8216;Ex-conjurer&#8217;s,&#8217; whose
system may be described as the triplet and spelling code. For the triplets he gives
a long list of numbered articles, arranged alphabetically, such as follow<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="column2">

<div class="column2l17">

<ul class="magic">
<li>1. Accordion, Album, Almanack.</li>
<li>2. Anchor, Apple, Apron.</li>
<li>3. Awl, Bag, Badge.</li>
</ul>

</div><!--column2l17-->

<div class="column2r17">

<ul class="magic">
<li>4. Ball, Bandana, Beads.</li>
<li>5. Bill of Exchange, Bodkin, Bonnet.</li>
<li class="padl3">Etc., etc.</li>
</ul>

</div><!--column2r17-->

</div><!--column2-->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span></p>

<p>For the first article in the triplet the performer merely gives the cue to the
number; to the second he adds <i>here</i>, and to the third <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>To work in with these he has also a numbered alphabet, both letters and figures
being represented by certain words as below<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>This code &#8216;Ex-conjurer&#8217; illustrates. &#8216;<i>Do you see</i> (W) what is this? <i>Come</i> (A),
<i>Let us know</i>? (T), <i>Hurry up</i> (C), <i>Answer</i> (H).&#8217; Surely this seems much too
roundabout a way of getting at such an ordinary article as a <i>watch</i>! Nor does that
of triplets offer great advantages, besides which the words or phrases chosen to
represent letters and numbers come in awkwardly&mdash;and even offensively to an
English ear&mdash;as will be apparent in the following extracts<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8216;Suppose a glove is offered. This is the first article of the fortieth triplet.
The question would be &#8220;<i>Tell us</i> (4) what this is, <i>there</i> (0).&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8216;Should the second article in the fifteenth triplet be offered, the question would
be either, &#8220;<i>Here</i>, what&#8217;s this? <i>Go on</i> (15);&#8221; or, &#8220;<i>Come</i> (1), what&#8217;s this <i>here</i>?
Well (5)?&#8221; and the answer in either case a <i>button-hook</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>The best thing about &#8216;Ex-conjurer&#8217;s&#8217; paper is the
suggestive &#8216;tag,&#8217; or speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
at the end of the performance. Our aspirants for &#8216;clairvoyant&#8217; fame may be able
to take a hint from it<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8216;Now, how is this done? Well, I don&#8217;t mind telling you, with the express
understanding that it goes no farther. It is neither mesmerism, spiritism, ventriloquism,
rheumatism nor any other ism. It is brought about by the action of arcane-dynamics,
subjectively submitted to the action of the passive agent, and the result,
as you have seen, is a stentonophonic reproduction of the original idea. I&#8217;m afraid
it&#8217;s not yet quite clear to some of you. Well, then, in other words, it&#8217;s a system of
mental telephony. When an article is offered to me, I seize it; and then my
assistant, he sees it. Ah! you smile&mdash;you understand it; but, remember, not a
word outside as to how it is done!&#8217;</p>

<p>The real second-sight, as practised by such eminent professors of the art as
Houdin and Heller, is greatly superior to &#8216;Ex-conjurer&#8217;s&#8217; code, and is contained
partly in our instructions, and more exhaustively in a work recently published. In
this the code for figures is arranged exactly in the same way as that given
by us; with the addition that the word &#8216;Quick&#8217; is used to give notice of
fractions. Then if the interlocutor says, &#8216;Tell, now!&#8217; the blindfolded wonder-worker
knows the initials indicate 1 and 2; therefore, by aid of the preliminary
warning, he (or she) ascertains that <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> is meant. Thus, if one-seventh had to be
signalled, after &#8216;Quick!&#8217; the cue might be given by saying, &#8216;Tell correctly, if you
please, what other numbers are there.&#8217;</p>

<p>The work now under consideration, in addition to a code for spelling words the
same as we have given, has also codes for money, coins, cards, colour, dates, etc.,
quite different from those in the preceding pages, and well worth perusal before
any particular system is fixed upon.</p>

<p>The book concludes with an observation that an exhibitor of second sight will
as likely as not tell you that this or that system is not the one by which his
&#8216;clairvoyant&#8217; reads mentally; and here the professor may speak quite truly.
Nevertheless&mdash;and this point cannot be too frequently insisted upon, because
abnormal, and even supernatural, power is frequently spoken of in connection with
second sight&mdash;there is nothing in the mystery that cannot be solved with a little
patience and perseverance; and you may feel satisfied that by a code and by that
alone&mdash;word-signals carefully studied and rehearsed between the clairvoyant and
the interlocutor&mdash;do all the seeming wonders come to pass.</p>

<h4>&#8216;<span class="smcap">Unconscious Counting.</span>&#8217;</h4>

<p>We cannot more suitably conclude this chapter than by referring to an ingenious
article some time ago on &#8216;unconscious counting&#8217; in the <i>Gartenlaube</i>, in which the
writer, Herr W. Preyer, points out that the ability possessed by any one of ordinary
intelligence to distinguish three, four, or even five objects at a glance, and without
being conscious of counting them, may by practice be perfected to such a degree
that it becomes quite as easy to count ten objects as it is to count three, and that it
is possible to give the exact number up to thirty objects at a single glance. As an
example of the latter attainment, the writer points to the well-known arithmetician
Dase, who died in 1861, and who declared that he could count thirty objects of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
same kind as quickly and easily as other people could count three or four. The
truth of the assertion was often proved when Dase, with lightning rapidity, gave the
correct number of a herd of sheep, of the books in a library, or the window-panes
in a large house. The test of how far any one can count at a glance is easily made
by putting several small objects, such as coins, pins, or matches, under a sheet of
paper, then lifting the paper for a second and looking at the objects, and, after
covering them again, give an estimate as to the number. At first it will be found
difficult to fix the number if there are more than from three to five objects, but the
eye becomes very soon accustomed to distinguish between larger numbers, so that
after a short time eight or nine objects will be counted by the eye with the same
facility. Care should, however, be taken that the counting is not done consciously,
for that would take far too much time; the number of objects should only be valued.</p>

<p>The mistakes which are at first frequently made in this guessing game will become
rarer and rarer, and almost anybody can become an expert in rapid counting up to
ten objects; after that it becomes more difficult. The sensation, says Herr Preyer,
of a person practised in unconscious counting, when looking attentively at larger
numbers of objects, is that their number shoots rapidly through the head. To
acquire this method of counting black spots should be made on white square pieces
of cardboard, first symmetrically and in small numbers, as, for instance, the
following<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo469a.png" alt="dots" width="500" height="151" />
</div>

<p>Afterwards their number may be increased and their position altered. It
will also be good practice to open a book, cover part of the page, rapidly
look at the lines left uncovered, and to guess
at their number. It is astonishing how soon
the eye gets accustomed to the numbers.
The more advanced &#8216;unconscious counter&#8217;
should practise on spots not regularly arranged,
which is much more difficult at first. Herr
Preyer concludes his interesting article with
the remark that unconscious counting, like all
other oft-repeated processes, such as lifting the hat as a token of salutation,
becomes at last an entirely mechanical process.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LVIII.&mdash;SPIRITUALISM AT HOME.<br />
<span class="smcap">By Dr. Stradling.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">Spiritualism does not in reality mean conjuring; of course you all know that.
But the term has now come to be familiarly applied to a certain class of performances,
without any pretence of supernatural aid or deceit, and arose in this way.
Some twenty-five years ago several people&mdash;the celebrated Davenport Brothers
among them&mdash;appeared in this country and America, and gave entertainments at
which they exhibited some very extraordinary and, at that time, novel effects of a
magical character, the leading features being their release from cords which had
been bound, knotted, and sealed upon them by members of the audience, leaving
the knots and seals unbroken; causing inanimate objects to fly about and musical
instruments to sound when it appeared impossible for any one to have touched
them; and divining numbers and sentences which had been written down privately,
unseen by them.</p>

<p>These things they professed to do, not by their own skill and dexterity, but by
the aid of &#8216;spirits&#8217; over whom they declared themselves to have control; and the
whole was accompanied with a lot of nonsense in the shape of luminous &#8216;manifestations&#8217;
in the air when the gas was turned out (for darkness was indispensable),
and &#8216;spirit-writings&#8217; on slates and sheets of cardboard&mdash;messages, supposed to
come from the unseen world, scrawled in a shocking bad hand that any boy would
be ashamed of! Nevertheless, a great deal that was done was new and very clever,
and had it only been honestly acknowledged to be the result of sleight-of-hand, the
performers would certainly have earned and well deserved the reward of success.</p>

<p>But though people go to see conjuring perfectly prepared and willing to be
deceived&mdash;if that can be called deception which is openly avowed to be misleading&mdash;they
do not like to have their common sense insulted by irreverence, such as
these spiritualists were guilty of in pretending to call up the dead; and a strong
feeling of indignation soon set in against the imposture and all who practised it.</p>

<p>Clever as the exhibitions were, also, one or two slips were made which were fatal
to them, though it does not ruin a straightforward conjurer to have a trick
accidentally discovered now and then. For instance, on one occasion, a dreadful
fiery hand, pale and deathly, though glowing with light, was seen sweeping through
the air, high overhead, rushing from end to end of the room with a swiftness that
no being could have possessed unless provided with wings, and at times descending
to give somebody a cold, clammy touch on the cheek. One, bolder than the rest,
had the courage to seize this hand, and, in spite of all opposition, insisted on retaining
it until the gas was turned up, when the spirit-hand was found to consist of
an old white kid glove, stuffed with damp tow and rubbed with phosphorus,
suspended at the end of a cord, and waved overhead by means of a long fishing-rod,
which folded up in short joints adapted for the &#8216;medium&#8217;s&#8217; pocket!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>

<p>Furthermore, professional conjurers were put on their mettle, and very quickly
showed that they could do, not only the same things, but much more wonderful
ones of a similar character in the full glare of the gaslight, without any aid from
spirits. The mysterious cabinet, which took such a prominent part in the Davenports&#8217;
programme, was soon robbed of its mystery; and in 1865 Professor Pepper&mdash;whose
name you will remember in connection with &#8216;Pepper&#8217;s Ghost&#8217; at the
Polytechnic&mdash;invented and patented a piece of apparatus, such as the spiritualists
had never dreamed of, called the &#8216;Cabinet of Proteus.&#8217;</p>

<p>The &#8216;mediums&#8217; have long since retired into comparative obscurity, and now
limit their manifestations to displays in private; but they still have a number of
followers who are ready to believe that what occurs at these gatherings is really the
work of invisible spirits, because they do not see how else it can be done. I heard
a famous conjurer say the other day, at the close of his entertainment, &#8216;If I have
been able to deceive and perplex you; if I, telling you beforehand that the effects
I was about to produce are the result of mere trickery and quickness of hand,
challenging your detection in the full light of the room, have succeeded in making
you, watchful and alert to find me out, imagine that black was white, and have convinced
you that seeing is <i>not</i> always believing, how much more might a skilful
impostor mystify a lot of superstitious people, already frightened out of their wits by
fear, in a dark chamber with accomplices!&#8217;</p>

<p>When, therefore, we read now of a spiritualistic <i>s&eacute;ance</i> given in public, or of
Messrs. Maskelyne and Cooke&#8217;s spirit manifestations, we understand the term to
have reference to feats of that description, which originated in the above manner;
and in telling you how you may exhibit a little &#8216;Spiritualism at Home&#8217; to your
friends, you will now see that I do not intend that you should even pretend to have
anything to do with supernatural causes, but only to perform some very astonishing
tricks on the same principle as you have been taught to make a halfpenny vanish
and reappear.</p>

<p>Modern effects of this kind, as they are presented on the stage, demand, as a
rule, not only great dexterity and years of practice, but the use of elaborate and
costly apparatus and the help of skilled assistants. All sorts of ingenious
mechanism, for which patents are often taken out&mdash;electricity, pneumatics, chemistry,
optics, magnetism, and nearly every science and art&mdash;are pressed into the
service, and the floor, the walls, the platform, and the ceiling may be riddled with
wires and traps and springs, for anything you know to the contrary; or the lady and
gentleman&mdash;or even the little boy or girl&mdash;sitting beside you may be confederates.
Now, if you will carefully carry out the directions which I am about to give you, you
will be able to do the following things&mdash;founded on the very essence of professed
spiritualism&mdash;viz., the rope-tying, the ringing of bells and beating of tambourines
without visible agency, mysterious writing, and secret reading&mdash;in your own or
anybody&#8217;s room, in the presence of any number of spectators, in the full light,
without preparation, without practice, without assistants or accomplices, without
sleight-of-hand, and without any apparatus, except (for one trick) a very simple
article, which any boy can make for himself in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Let me first describe the <i>effect</i> of the performance, without any explanation as to
how it is done&mdash;that is to say, as it will appear to your audience. You give
some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
one a piece of ordinary tape or ribbon, which they can examine as closely as they
please. One end of this ribbon, which is about two feet and a half long, is now
tied firmly around your wrist. Placing your hands behind your back, you then
allow the other end to be fastened around the other wrist in like manner. Thus
your hands are tied behind your back, each being secured separately, to prevent the
possibility of either slipping out, and the knots, or ends, are then sealed with
sealing wax and stamped with a crest or private mark for identification afterwards.
Sitting on a chair at the farther end of the room, with your back turned to the
company, you pass your arms over the back of the chair, so that all may see the
ribbon and seals; and while in this position you invite a spectator to step forward
and tie his handkerchief around the cross-bar of the back of the chair, including the
ligature which joins your two wrists, knotting the handkerchief tightly and sealing it
as well.</p>

<p>So that you are now practically tied to the chair, with your hands fastened
together behind you. Two of your audience then hold up a table-cloth or open
newspaper in front of you as a temporary screen&mdash;of course giving their word not to
look behind while so doing; a few bars of mysterious music are played on the
piano; in a minute, at a signal from you, the newspaper is snatched away, and you
are seen sitting in precisely the same attitude and bound as before, but with your
coat removed and lying across your knees! Knots and seals are all discovered on
examination to be firm and intact, nor does the cross-bar or any other portion of
the chair &#8216;unship.&#8217;</p>

<p>No assistant could have approached you without being seen, and your coat can
be passed round, to show that there is nothing peculiar in its construction. You
can, if you please, be screened once more for a minute, and put it on again, and the
second time you may be found standing beside the chair, entirely free from it, yet
having your hands secured as tightly as ever behind your back, and leaving the
sealed and knotted handkerchief undisturbed around the cross-bar. This, performed
in a dark cabinet, was Ira Davenport&#8217;s great feat.</p>

<p>But you may elaborate this much further, and just as easily give some &#8216;manifestations&#8217;
which are truly astounding. The principle which lies at the bottom of it
all is very little known, even among professional wizards, and not one person in ten
thousand would as much as guess at it. Your hands are tied and secured to the
chair in the same manner as last described; but now, in addition, you have your
legs and ankles bound to the legs of the chair, and a rope or strap passed around
your body. Perfect strangers may do all the tying, and everything is sealed.</p>

<p>This time you had better have a regular screen&mdash;a sheet or tablecloth thrown
across a clothes-horse makes the best possible&mdash;and let it be so arranged that, while
hiding your body, it leaves your feet visible. They can therefore <i>see</i> for themselves
that you never move from the chair for a single instant, even if it were possible to
do so. Handkerchiefs around the ankles will be better seen than cords or ropes.
The screen must stand well out in the room, so that there may be no suspicion of a
confederate &#8216;lending you a hand&#8217; from any door. On a small table, concealed by
the screen, but <i>quite out of your reach</i>, even if your hands were free, are placed a
bell, a tambourine, an umbrella, and a slate or sheet of blank paper.</p>

<p>A few seconds after the clothes-horse has been pulled in front of you&mdash;or
rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
<i>behind</i> you and in front of the audience, for you are sitting with your back towards
them&mdash;the bell is heard to ring violently, and the umbrella, <i>open</i>, rises above the
screen, dancing up and down in time to the music of the piano, presently hitching
itself on the top rail. Then your coat comes flying over, and the tambourine is
thumped and rattled, the bell never ceasing to ring energetically. Finally you give
a shout, as agreed upon, the screen is quickly drawn aside, the bell and tambourine
are seen to fall from <i>somewhere</i>&mdash;where, nobody can tell&mdash;and roll clashing and
clattering over the floor before the eyes of all. The umbrella is open, your coat is
off, the slate or paper is covered with writing. Yet not a single knot is untied nor
a single seal broken: you are in exactly the same position as at first, and none of
the articles show any trace of wax or thread. Bear in mind, too, that the
spectators have had your feet, the legs of the chair, and those of the table, in full
view the whole time, and will have seen that none of them moved in the slightest
degree.</p>

<p>The mysterious reading or calculation may be done in conjunction with this, or
as a trick by itself. When you have the method which forms its foundation, you
can arrange its effect in a dozen different ways, according to your fancy. Perhaps
the best and least complicated form is, before you are tied up, to pass round half a
dozen slips of paper or cardboard, with a lead pencil, requesting each of the six people
to whom they are distributed to write a number&mdash;any number they please&mdash;thereon
in legible figures, secretly. The slips are collected in an envelope, fastened, and
brought to you, and you entrust them to the &#8216;best arithmetician&#8217; in the room,
when the rest of the audience have decided who that lucky individual may be, to be
opened and added together, without declaring their total or mentioning a word
about them, whilst you are behind the screen. Then the number discovered on the
sheet of paper or slate will prove to be the exact amount, or the tambourine may fly
over and fall before them with the sum total mysteriously inscribed upon it&mdash;even
before the arithmetician has added the numbers together. Or, as I say, this
may constitute an experiment of itself, and the total may be found on a card
hitherto blank, or written inside the lining of somebody&#8217;s hat, which is placed upon
the owner&#8217;s head and retained there before the slips are even passed round. Or,
before the total is declared, it may be written down privately by the one who has
made the addition, the cards burnt, and the ashes rubbed on the performer&#8217;s bare
arm; when, in the midst of the bluish smudge they produce, the amount will
appear in figures of inky blackness.</p>

<p>So much for &#8216;Spiritualism at Home,&#8217; as viewed from the &#8216;front.&#8217; Now come
behind the scenes and learn the <i>modus operandi</i>. It will not involve a very lengthy
description.</p>

<p>The whole of the coat-stripping, bell-ringing, tambourine-beating, umbrella-opening,
and other man&#339;uvres executed under shelter of the screen depend upon
the fact that it is actually possible to remove one hand from the tape or ribbon
which is bound around the wrist and to replace it again without untying the knot!
To understand this, just tie one end of a piece of cord around anything&mdash;say, the
leg of a chair; that will, no doubt, be firm and secure enough. But now proceed
to fasten the other end round the other leg, and you will perceive, on considering
the matter, that you have <i>only one end to tie with</i>, instead of two as before.
The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
other end is fixed, and cannot be made use of, so that, tie as you will, you can only
form a series of loops&mdash;in nautical phrase, &#8216;half-hitches&#8217;&mdash;around one straight
piece. What is the consequence? Why, that these loops, being nothing more than
so many rings strung on the line which comes from the other leg of the chair, can
be slid backwards and forwards along it. When you have tied the second leg up
tightly and neatly, and to all appearance as securely as the other, you have only to
slip these rings, or knots, back towards the first leg, to allow of the second being
drawn out, and on replacing it again you slide them back against it as firm as ever,
having untied nothing.</p>

<p>This is precisely what you do with the last-tied wrist behind the screen, except
that it is much more easily accomplished in this case than with the leg of a chair,
because you can relax the long piece, and so give yourself more space by bringing
the hands a little nearer to each other. It is difficult to comprehend this from a
written description, and a diagram would be of little use to illustrate it, but you will
see it readily on following out the successive steps just mentioned.</p>

<p>Let us go through the trick for the sake of noting one or two little points which
require some care. Tape is better than string or rope, and ribbon is best of all,
because, from the silk in its composition, it is slippery, and will glide smoothly,
without requiring to be tugged, or being in danger of getting &#8216;jammed.&#8217; The first wrist
is tied before you; the manner in which it is done does not concern you, though
you could, if need be, &#8216;capsize&#8217; an ordinary knot&mdash;reef or granny&mdash;and convert it
into the same condition as that applied to the second wrist. This, however, will be
quite unnecessary. Nevertheless, you had better observe the mode in which this first
knot is tied, for this reason: it would be possible for some skilful person&mdash;a sailor,
for instance&mdash;to put a &#8216;clove hitch,&#8217; or some other nautical complication, around
the second wrist, which could not be manipulated in the way described. You are
not likely to meet with anybody who will treat you so, and of course, in speaking
of knots, one means the ordinary arrangements, such as nine hundred and ninety-nine
people out of a thousand will tie.</p>

<p>But if you <i>should</i> find somebody who is clever and ill-natured enough to try to
baffle you, let him tie away to his heart&#8217;s content on the first wrist, then, &#8216;to show
there is no deception or confederacy,&#8217; move on to some one else for the second.
The best way is always to go to a lady; probably she will only tie a simple bow at
first, which you will pull open at once, making a great merit of scorning to take
advantage of such a thing, and requesting, for your own satisfaction, to be secured
in a manner which will leave no doubt in the minds of the audience, etc., etc. The
second wrist is tied behind your back, and when both are thus encircled a straight
piece, about one foot in length, will connect the two hands.</p>

<p>But how about the seals? You will perceive that the knots in both cases lie
close against the flesh, and it is only possible to put on the merest dot of wax&mdash;<i>and
this on the loops themselves</i>&mdash;without burning the skin. Thus they will carry
the seal unbroken with them as they slip backwards and forwards. But since there
is, even so, a chance of your getting scorched, it is better in every way to request
that an end of about two inches long be left in each case&mdash;you can adjust it yourself
with the first wrist, as a pattern for the second&mdash;explaining your reason, and have
this sealed down to the long piece which intervenes. You can have the end of
it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
sewn as well if you like. The more you are apparently hampered by precautions
and impossibilities the more wonderful and impressive the feat becomes, and it
must be evident to all that the knots cannot be untied when the ends are made fast
without breaking the seals.</p>

<p>The handkerchief around the cross-bar of the chair, like the ankle-fetters and
ropes around the body in the more elaborate version of the trick, are merely for the
sake of effect, and are of no consequence to you at all; but be sure to draw just as
much attention to these as the other, and lay as great stress on their being sealed.</p>

<p>Now I think you see how to proceed. Directly you are hidden by the newspaper
catch hold of the knots last tied with the fingers of the opposite hand, and
slide them gently outwards from the wrist towards the seal. This will enlarge the
loop by a good inch or an inch and a half&mdash;more than enough to enable you to
withdraw the hand. The arms are now free from one another, the ribbon with the
enlarged loop at the end of it dangling from the first-tied wrist. This is pulled
through the loop of the handkerchief, the coat quickly removed, and the whole
process then simply reversed&mdash;the arms brought together behind the chair again,
ribbon passed through loop of handkerchief, hand passed into the noose, and knots
slipped back to the skin, tighter than ever. Putting on the coat is managed just in
the same way. If you want to appear freed from the chair, do not pass the ribbon
within the handkerchief in replacing your hand; or you may produce a most
puzzling result, if you like, by twisting it around the cross-bar instead.</p>

<p>Do not be &#8216;flurried&#8217; or over-eager. Remember, if you took half an hour about
it the performance would be just as mysterious and incapable of explanation. You
may, however, <i>apparently</i> shorten the time employed in its execution by asking
some young lady to oblige you with a little appropriate music as soon as the screen
is raised. &#8216;Something very solemn and soothing&mdash;a little slower, if you please;
thank you, that will do nicely&#8217;&mdash;working away all the time. &#8216;Now then, who&#8217;s
got a watch? You have, sir? Has it a second-hand? Now, kindly tell me when
one minute has expired,&#8217; and so on, according to the amount of delay you require.
Always take care that there is no light behind you, or the screen will become transparent;
and place your chair where you will not be reflected in any looking-glass.</p>

<p>But the bell-ringing and tambourine-beating, combined with this, will absolutely
astonish your friends, for this is what fills the public with greater wonder than anything
else, even when performed by professional conjurers amidst all the appliances
of a regular stage. For this you will want some instrument which can lie folded up
inside your waistcoat (not coat); it must therefore be not more than a foot long
when not in use, but capable of being expanded to such a length as will enable you
to reach the articles on the table with it while still sitting on your chair&mdash;the distance
is not likely to be more than four feet at the outside. Indeed, it is not necessary to
have it so much, for everybody will be able to see that you do not move from the
chair. This may consist either of a sort of fishing-rod of four pieces, or a jointed
rod made to fold up by hinges on the same principle as a pocket foot-rule, so that
the joints bend in one direction, but are stiff in the other. If either of these is
used, there must be a crook at the end to hook up the umbrella and tambourine,
and the bell must have a loop of string attached to it, unless you choose to have a
line running through an eye, as with a regular fishing-rod, and angle for the
articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
with a noose. Much better, to my thinking, is that little bit of apparatus&mdash;commonly
sold with boxes of toy-soldiers-known as &#8216;lazy-tongs.&#8217; It is formed, as
I dare say you know, by a number of <span class="lettsymb"><b>X</b></span>-shaped slips of wood, joined together at
the extremities in a sort of lattice (<span class="lettsymb"><b>XXXX</b></span>). The rivets are loosely fixed, so that
by pressing the arms of the end <span class="lettsymb"><b>X</b></span> together the whole shoots out to its full length,
and, by separating them again, the &#8216;tongs&#8217; fold up. You will see the same action
exemplified in those ornamental lattice-fences which are made to surround flower-pots
in a drawing-room. By means of this, the things on the table can not only be
hooked, but pinched up if required, and can be rattled about there before they
come near your hands. If writing-paper is used instead of a slate, a pellet of bees&#8217;-wax
or a drawing-pin must be fixed at the end of the tongs.</p>

<p>Having freed your wrist as before, get hold of the bell first and seize the handle
between your teeth, where you retain it the whole time, ringing it by shakes and
nods of your head. Next bring over the umbrella and open it, causing it to appear
above the screen and dance as described; you may even shoot it out beyond the
side of the screen on the lazy-tongs, far beyond your arms&#8217; reach, &#8216;even if they were
not tied behind your back.&#8217; Hang the umbrella on the top rail of the clothes-horse,
and divest yourself of your coat, flinging it over. Then fetch the tambourine,
ringing the bell as hard as you can all the while. Beat time to the piano for a few
moments, making the umbrella dance again in unison. The tongs must hang on
your arm when not wanted, for do not forget that the audience have a full view of
the floor, and that if you drop anything you cannot pick it up again. To drop the
lazy-tongs would reveal the secret entirely, but the other articles do not matter so
much. Now if you are going to do any writing, get the paper or slate, the pencil
will be in your waistcoat-pocket, and you can use the tambourine as a desk. Finally,
tuck the latter under your chin, and roll the edge of the bell to and fro upon it
while you tie yourself up again; give a shout, as the prearranged signal for somebody
to remove the screen, releasing the bell and tambourine at the same
instant. Down they fall, and go rolling and jingling over the floor before the
spectators, and there you are, bound and strapped, as close a prisoner as ever!</p>

<p>I said you could do all this without practice, and so you can, since there is no
sleight-of-hand or dexterity involved. But you had better rehearse once or twice
privately before giving an exhibition, to see that you have everything in working
order; by so doing you will acquire confidence, and produce your effects one after
the other in a much shorter space of time, while you may hit on many others. For
instance, if your table is one of those small, light, ornamental affairs resting on a
single stem, you might cause it to rock violently by means of your tongs, and to
&#8216;walk&#8217; from one edge of the screen to the other, the audience being able to watch
the motion of its feet. If you like you may even have your elbows secured to the
back of the chair, and will still be sufficiently at liberty to do all but take your coat
off. The great thing is to make all the effects fit in with one another compactly.</p>

<p>Some years ago a noted conjurer introduced a feature into his entertainment
which, for a time, startled the public. He allowed himself to be handcuffed by any
policeman present who would fetch a pair of Government handcuffs for the purpose;
these were locked, and the key retained by the constable or some other member of
the audience. The performer then stepped behind a curtain, and presently
came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
out, still manacled, but minus his coat. But after a bit it suddenly occurred to some
one that all the Scotland Yard handcuffs issued to the police were made on the
same pattern, and that the magician had only to unlock them with a duplicate key
kept in a little pocket at the back of his waistcoat!</p>

<p>Now for the &#8216;Mysterious Addition,&#8217; or &#8216;Spirit-writing.&#8217; Six small pieces of
cardboard or paper are distributed, and those to whom they are given are requested
to pencil some number consisting of any figures they please. Let these people
be separated as much as possible, ostensibly to show that there is no collusion, but
really to prevent any comparing of notes; enjoin strict secrecy, too, as to the
numbers written, for similar reasons. Let somebody collect the folded slips in one
of those small envelopes such as are used for &#8216;Your change, with thanks,&#8217; in
shops, fasten it, and bring it to you. You go back to your table and lay it carelessly
thereon, bringing forward your piece of ribbon instead, as though to save time;
and while the first knot is being tied you ask, Who is the best arithmetician in the
room? This being decided, you go back and get the envelope before the second
wrist is tied, giving it to him with a pencil and plate, and bidding him, when he
has added the six numbers together, to say nothing, but make a private memorandum
of the amount, burn the slips on the plate, and keep the ashes for you.</p>

<p>In laying the little envelope &#8216;carelessly&#8217; on the table, where you have your
ribbon, candle, matches, plates, rope, sealing-wax, etc., in readiness, you are careless
or careful enough to place it so that it shall be hidden by the rim of the plate, side
by side with another little envelope of precisely similar appearance, also concealed
by the margin of the plate. This second envelope contains six slips of paper or
card, too, and on these you have written&mdash;in pencil, and in different &#8216;hands&#8217;&mdash;six
numbers, the total of which is known to you. Let us suppose that you have put
209, 23, 1000, 7, 51, and 346; the sum of these is 1636, and is discovered to be
such by the arithmetician&mdash;who, of course, is not chosen from among the six, &#8216;to
prevent any deception,&#8217; but is wholly independent of them&mdash;when you hand him
this second envelope instead of the genuine one. Behind the screen, therefore,
you have only to write 1636 on the slate or tambourine, which will be found to
tally with his memorandum. Or, if you are doing this trick by itself, paint 1636 on
your arm in glycerine with a fine brush, and let it dry in before commencing. This
being transparent, will be quite invisible till the ashes are rubbed in, when the
number will stand out jet black. You can vary this in a dozen ways, by writing
the number and concealing it somewhere beforehand, since the amounts which the
audience put down on <i>their</i> slips do not affect <i>you</i> at all. In every case it is well
to have the slips burnt, and you can ask to have the numbers restricted within the
hundreds&mdash;that is, in three figures&mdash;on the plea that it will otherwise be tedious
to add up. Make your own amounts rather larger than those given above by way
of example.</p>

<p>Of course no comparisons are made, or, even if any two or three did compare, no
one can dispute the accuracy of the total, for no one knows what the numbers
were beyond his or her own figures; and the addition is beyond suspicion when
made by a representative whom the audience choose for themselves. But, you will
ask, how is the first envelope concealed when you take up the plate to receive the
ashes? Simply by having two plates, as though to provide against
contingencies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
and giving the upper one, using the other to stand the candlestick upon if you like,
and pushing it back a few inches casually to cover what was behind it.</p>

<p>If you prefer it, you may take out your handkerchief and draw it lightly over your
arm after it is bared while the slips are being collected; then throw it casually on
the table beside the plate to serve as a mask; or you may have a few spare handkerchiefs
ready on the table and dispense with the plate as a means of concealment
altogether. You will draw attention to the fact that you have handkerchiefs wherewith
you may be secured if nobody will lend them, but that of course you prefer to
use borrowed ones. Conjuring tables with traps and shelves are utterly unnecessary
for small articles which cannot be seen by those seated a little way off if the
smallest projection intervenes.</p>

<p>Always have everything ready and in its place before commencing. If you
have to leave the room for anything in the middle of a trick your audience suspect
something, and the effect is spoiled. Make a list: candle in candlestick, matches,
sealing-wax, ribbon, scissors (for cutting the knots at the conclusion), rope, strap,
chair, tablecloth or newspaper, screen, bell, umbrella, slate, tambourine, lazy-tongs,
pencil, small envelope, slips, plates, duplicate envelope. The last need give you no
anxiety, you can have it in your match-box, if you please, and coolly put it in the
desired position while standing with your back to the people, &#8216;setting&#8217; your table
before commencing.</p>

<p>Talking of &#8216;spirit-writing&#8217; reminds me of an anecdote&mdash;a problem put before
me the other day by a post-office boy which might well have perplexed the cleverest
of conjurers. I was sending a paper which I had just written to the Editor of the
<i>Boy&#8217;s Own Paper</i>, but was uncertain about the amount of postage, so I stepped
into the office to have it weighed and get stamps. Manuscript for the press goes
at book-post rate if the ends are left open, and &#8216;Manuscript&#8217; is marked on the
wrapper.</p>

<p>&#8216;Printed matter?&#8217; asked the youthful and conscientious official (evidently a new
hand) to whom I handed the document, as he prepared to put it in the scales.</p>

<p>&#8216;No; manuscript,&#8217; I replied. &#8216;But it&#8217;s all the same; book-post tariff covers it.&#8217;</p>

<p>The boy was obviously not quite satisfied on this point, for, having weighed the
packet, he referred to a big book, doubtfully. &#8216;Twopence-halfpenny,&#8217; he presently
decided; &#8216;it will go for twopence-halfpenny, <i>provided there&#8217;s no writing inside</i>!&#8217;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LIX.&mdash;FIRE-BALLOONS AND GAS-BALLOONS: HOW
TO MAKE AND USE THEM.<br />
<span class="smcap">By the late Dr. Scoffern.</span></h3>

<h4 class="fsize80">I.&mdash;THE PRINCIPLE OF BALLOONING.</h4>

<p class="noindent">Every boy at some time or other, I suppose, has felt himself irresistibly drawn
towards the subject of toy-balloons; but first unaided experiments in that direction
seldom prove altogether satisfactory, or maybe even pleasant. It is my intention,
therefore, to go into the matter thoroughly and practically, explaining all about fire-balloons,
and telling you at once how to make and use them.</p>

<p>If a thing&mdash;anything&mdash;be placed in the midst of any other thing lighter than
itself, and if thing number two be not a solid, but either a liquid or a gas, both which
permit of motion in any direction, then thing number one will ascend.</p>

<p>If you want to have this demonstrated, just plunge a cork down into water and
see what happens. If instead of a cork you were to take a lump of iron&mdash;say a
cannon ball&mdash;then the very idea of such a heavy material floating would seem to you
ridiculous. It will float, nevertheless, not in water, truly, but in any fluid of greater
weight than itself. Quicksilver, otherwise called mercury, is such a fluid, and the
very experiment I have supposed you to perform for curiosity is actually turned to
practical account by artillerists when they wish to ascertain whether a cannon ball is
equally heavy on every part of corresponding size around the centre. If not equally
heavy, then spots marked upon it will not float upwards equally well. If any
particular spot insists on turning downwards, then the result proves that one side of
the round cannon ball (please excuse the word side, a sphere really has no sides) is
heavier than the rest.</p>

<p>But to return to our balloons. Well, please remember the globe on which we
live is surrounded by an atmosphere&mdash;air we call it&mdash;and also please understand this
atmosphere has weight; consequently it follows that anything lighter than the
atmosphere will ascend in the atmosphere. In this we have the whole theory of
balloons and ballooning.</p>

<p>The air has weight,&mdash;yes, more than you have been accustomed to think, perhaps.
Just take the pen or pencil and mark out a piece of paper one square inch. Having
marked out this, you are to understand that the air presses upon it with a force of
about fifteen pounds. I say <i>about</i>, for the reason that atmospheric pressure is not
always exactly the same. Sometimes it presses rather more, at other times rather
less than fifteen pounds, but still the variation is not great.</p>

<p>Thus, air has weight, and you also know that air, being a fluid, permits objects to
move about in it, so it follows that if we can find anything number two lighter than
the air, it will ascend in the air. We shall look in vain amongst liquids and solids
for thing number two, all being heavier than air; but of gases lighter than air there
exist several. Why not use them? We can use some of them, and we
presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
will; but it stands to reason that we can no more use a gas for lifting a weight up
into air without first putting the gas into a bag, than we can use a horse for carriage-draught
without first putting a collar round his neck, then attaching shaft and traces:
no, indeed, not so well even, because in a case of emergency a carriage might be
fixed to the horse&#8217;s tail!</p>

<p>The very simplest form of balloon is a soap-bubble. Most of us have probably
at some time or other amused ourselves by blowing soap-bubbles, without perhaps
troubling ourselves to understand the whys and wherefores of the case.</p>

<p>Why is it that a soap-bubble blown with air from the lungs ascends? You will
tell me perhaps that it ascends because the air which comes from the lungs is of a
lighter &#8216;nature&#8217; than the atmosphere No, indeed, instead of having a lighter it has
a heavier nature. Though air which comes out of the lungs is by &#8216;nature&#8217; <i>heavier</i>
than air which goes into the lungs, yet at the same time it is warmer, and for the
reason of that warmth it remains during the existence of the warmth practically
lighter.</p>

<p>This circumstance being remembered, you will at once understand why it is that
a soap-bubble, even if it lives&mdash;so to put the case&mdash;long enough, does not continue
to ascend as a balloon would have continued, but first slackens in its upward course,
then descends, the reason of descent being the cooling of the air within it. If you
had been clever enough to measure that soap-bubble twice, first at the very moment
of rising, next at the last moment of setting, you would have found the warmer bubble
to have been the larger.</p>

<p>If you were to blow a thin bag full of air, you would not expect it to ascend, on
the supposition, that is to say, that the bagged air and the free air are of one and the
same temperature; but if you could manage to make the bagged air hot, and keep
it hot, then you would get lifting power. This is exactly what is done in the
Montgolfier, or fire-balloon.</p>

<p>The reason of this seems very simple when one comes to think about it, yet the
Brothers Montgolfier, inventors of the fire-balloon, did not exactly see the true
science of the balloon that bears their name. They appeared to have reasoned
somewhat in the following manner. A wreath of smoke ascends, therefore smoke
must be lighter than air; therefore a bag filled with smoke, and kept full of smoke,
should also ascend, supposing the bag to be made of sufficiently light materials.</p>

<p>If the Montgolfiers had said, instead of smoke, hot air, they would have truly
represented the fact.</p>

<p>They made a bag of canvas, and they lined it with paper. Under the neck of
this bag they hung a sort of fire-grate, and underneath this, but within reach of it, a
car. Impressed as they were with the smoky notion, one of their first cares was to
feed the fireplace with some variety of fuel that would yield abundant smoke.
Chopped straw, slightly damped and mixed with wool, was one of the favoured
combustibles.</p>

<p>Fire, or Montgolfier balloons, large enough to take up sky travellers, are no
longer used; air-balloons, or, as it would be more proper to call them, gas-balloons,
being more convenient and at the same time more safe. Toy fire-balloons are,
however, still made and let off as a pretty firework, and I shall now describe the best
and easiest ways of making them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<h4 class="fsize80">II.&mdash;FIRE-BALLOONS AND THEIR CONSTRUCTION.</h4>

<p>They may be constructed of any size; but an overgrown fire-balloon, according
to my experience, is seldom satisfactory, and never returns value for the money
expended in making it. As a boy I was a great fire-balloon maker. I have made
them of various sizes; at length, however, coming to the conclusion that three sheets
of tissue-paper, pasted end to end, then cut into shape and joined, make a balloon
quite large enough to manage, and also large enough for every ornamental purpose.</p>

<p>&#8216;Cut into shape,&#8217; did I not say the paper was to be? Well, what sort of a shape?
Perhaps I need not tell you that a perfectly globular bag will hold more than any
other shaped bag you could make out of a given quantity of paper. A peeled
orange or lemon will give the very best idea of the general shape of the gussets of a
balloon. Speaking generally, the narrower you cut the gussets of your balloon the
neater will be your turn out; but of course, if
narrow gussets be employed, more of them
will be needed than if you employed wide
gussets. Neatness of manufacture is of no
account when brought to bear on a toy firework
that, after a few moments of ascent, reveals
itself to lookers-on merely as a patch of moving
light.</p>

<div class="figc260">

<div class="figleft" id="FigLIX01">
<img src="images/illo483a.png" alt="baloon" width="113" height="401" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>

<img src="images/illo483b.png" alt="balloon" width="106" height="401" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>After many trials, I came to the conclusion
that when using tissue-paper, three sheets pasted
narrow edge to narrow edge, eight gussets
were enough. Occasionally, however, I would
slightly elongate each gusset by attaching one
of the little corners <i>a</i> or <i>b</i>, and fixing it at <i>c</i>. Of
course the pieces <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> have to be cut away
in any case, else the necessary gussets could
not be made.</p>

<p>With regard to the exact shape of a finished
balloon, always remember that the more nearly
globular it is the more gas or air will it hold,
and the more stable will be its flight. Assuming
you to have pasted end to end three
sheets of tissue-paper, with the little bit (<i>c</i>)
added to the top part over and above, I recommend you to divide, mentally at least,
the three sheets and bit added, rectangle, into four parts. Of these the two middle
parts need not be cut or trimmed at all. All the trimming needful can be done on
the two end parts. Another thing&mdash;do not give any care to bringing the crown, or
summit, of the balloon to a point. You will have to paste on what we call a round
summit, or crown, at any rate, under which circumstance your bringing all the
gussets to one terminal point is of no consequence. In cutting out the gussets, this
is best done on the double, which will ensure symmetry.</p>

<p>You will tell me, perhaps, there is a sort of regularity about my preliminary
work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
that does not please the eye. You would like, perhaps, to make a graceful balloon
like <a href="#FigLIX03">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

<p>Better not. Do you not see what would happen when you came to set light to
the fuel suspended under the mouth of the balloon? The flame would almost
certainly strike against the paper of the narrow neck, and presently the whole balloon
would be in a blaze.</p>

<p>Having cut out your gussets, the next thing is to join them. First as to cement.
Use thin paste or gum water, which you please, and employ a camel-hair, or better,
a sable-brush, to spread it. Half an inch lap is quite enough; and when the
necessary paper junction has been made, I like to dry my work at once by means
of a laundress&#8217;s smoothing iron. Taking this precaution, you will have no sticking
at spots where sticking ought not to be.</p>

<p>A final word now about the best way of bringing the edges of your gussets
together. The line diagram
here given will
make all comprehensible:
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> represent,
we will say, two gussets.</p>

<p>The edge of <i>a</i> is
alone to be gummed or
pasted to about half an
inch wide; the corresponding
edge of <i>b</i> is
then to be bent down
upon the cemented edge
of <i>a</i>, and dried at once
with the laundress&#8217;s hot
iron; not laid naked
upon the paper, but
having a thickness of
flannel interposed. Proceeding
thus all round,
you will at last finish
your balloon all but the crown pieces and mouth stiffener. For a balloon of the
dimensions recommended, I would advise you to paste on a crown piece of about
a foot diameter. Don&#8217;t make it of tissue-paper, but of soft whitey brown paper, and
in the middle of it paste a loop of calico, something similar to the loop of a saucepan
lid. The utility of this will be found out when you come to let off your balloon.</p>

<p>As a mouth stiffener I prefer a circle of thick iron or brass wire to anything else.
About three inches from the balloon-mouth had better be strengthened by a layer of
calico, which being gashed or scalloped (<a href="#FigLIX05">Fig. 5</a>), pasted and turned over the wire
hoop, makes all firm. As to dimensions of mouth, I consider a circle of eighteen
inches&#8217; diameter quite big enough, and boys will please remember that three times
and about one-seventh of a diameter makes the circumference of a circle.</p>

<p>Having made your balloon, the next thing to do, as it would seem, is to let it off.</p>

<p>Not exactly. You expect your balloon to lift a weight&mdash;fireworks
probably&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>which
I will describe how to manage by-and-by. It will be necessary, then, to learn
by experiment how much weight it will carry; otherwise, when the time of letting
off arrives, you may fail altogether, and be much disappointed.</p>

<p>The weight-carrying experiment must be performed in a room, to avoid air-currents,
and, as a preliminary, some sort of car
must be attached to the balloon for the purpose of
holding the weights. The car may be of various
shapes, but as good a shape as any is this<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLIX07">
<img src="images/illo485a.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="252" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.&mdash;<span class="smcap">CAR.</span></p>
</div>

<p>It may be made out of cardboard, or, if you
like, of wire. You need not be particular about
any sort of elegance. Fire-balloons are designed
to be sent on their travels at night, when any sort
of ornament or elegance lavished on the car would
not be seen.</p>

<p>The usual flame for heating the air in a paper
balloon is spirits of wine. Methylated spirit does
very well, and is much cheaper than pure spirits of
wine. I do not recommend this source of flame when the balloon comes to be
actually let off, as you will by-and-by see; but for our present experiment I do
recommend it. You must make a note of the weight of spirits of wine presently
to be used, and, if you do not
happen to have scales and weights
handy, you may take it for granted
that a sherry wineglass full weighs
about an ounce.</p>

<p>Ascertain, too, how much the
car weighs. Probably, when the
time comes for letting off the
balloon, you will not require the
car, so you should have ascertained
its weight, that you may supply a
weight equivalent, in the shape of
fireworks, for example.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLIX08">
<img src="images/illo485b.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="330" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 8.&mdash;<span class="smcap">CHAMBER TRIAL OF THE BALLOON.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Two boys will be wanted for
performance of the chamber experiment;
one to stand upon a
chair or stool, so as to be able
to lift the crown of the balloon,
the other to manage the flame
department&mdash;to do what engineers
would call the stoking (<a href="#FigLIX08">Fig. 8</a>).</p>

<p>The spirit, you will remember, is not to be burned loosely, but absorbed by
something or other. Sponge is the absorptive medium usually employed, though
some operators use cotton wick. On the present occasion of chamber experiment I
recommend you to employ sponge. The very coarsest sponge will do as well as
the finest and most expensive. Such a piece as most oilmen sell under the
name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
of &#8216;slate sponge,&#8217; and generally for a penny, will do quite well for the chamber
experiment.</p>

<p>Let me now give you boys a piece of advice, and do not consider it of small
value. It is of enormous value, being the value of the difference between success
and failure. I do not only mean success or failure in the experiment you are about
to perform, but any experiment. The advice is this:&mdash;Attend well to detail.
Before you set about performing any experiment take care that you have provided,
and arranged well to hand, everything necessary to the performance of the experiment.
Do not say to yourself, this, that, or the other is a trifle, and as a trifle
neglect it. In all experimental work, having once determined in your own mind
the various things and arrangements necessary, nothing amongst them can be a
trifle. Well, to the point. Provide yourself, by loan if your pocket-money does not
run so far, with some handfuls of farthings. This little coin will be about the most
convenient thing you can use for seeing how much weight your balloon will take up.
You are ready. Well, No. 1, as I will call you, lay hold of the crown of the balloon,
then jump on a stool or chair, lifting the entire balloon up in such way that the
mouth of it may be conveniently disposed for what has to be done by No. 2.</p>

<p>Previous arrangements having been made, it will be well, to avoid accidents, for
No. 2 to partially inflate the balloon by a fan. Were this precaution not taken, it
might happen that flame driven against the tissue-paper might set it on fire. Those
who have not tried the experiment little know what power there is in a fan to set up
and keep going a current of air. Sometimes people revive a sluggish fire by
hanging a sheet of paper in front of it, but a far better application of the paper is to
squeeze it into a rough fan and begin fanning. My attention was first called to
this fire-fanning process when, travelling in Andalusia, I wanted some chocolate in a
hurry, at a lonely wayside <i>posada</i>. A damsel, fan in hand, lighted a bit of charcoal
with a paper spill, laid it on the stove grating, put other charcoal round it, the
chocolate-pot over all, and began fanning.</p>

<p>You are now ready to learn how much weight your balloon will carry. You
will have attached the car, of course. You will have laid your bit of sponge on the
tin pan already attached, and you will have remembered to steady the sponge and
keep it from falling out by passing a little iron binding wire over the surface of it,
and attaching the wire to the tin pan. All this having been done, you are to pour
the spirits of wine upon the sponge and set fire to it. Presently the balloon,
becoming charged with hot air, will fill out and rise. When risen, be prepared with
your money&mdash;farthings. Throw in farthing upon farthing until your balloon not
only can carry no more, but comes down. Let it come down, and let the spirit
flame burn quite out. Any attempt at blowing it out would probably set the
balloon in a blaze.</p>

<p>You have gained now the information required; you have learned what weight,
when the serious time of letting off arrives, your balloon will carry. Count the
farthings and make a memorandum of their weight. There is no particular mystery
in the choice of farthings; they are cheap enough, and they are small enough.
Sovereigns and half-sovereigns will do quite well, and if you are sufficiently &#8216;warm&#8217;
in pocket-money, you may employ them instead of farthings, over which they
present the advantage of recording the actual weight. A sovereign newly
minted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
weighs one hundred and twenty-three grains and a small fraction; a half-sovereign
half that weight. Taking one sovereign with another, you may assume one hundred
and twenty-three grains to be the weight of each. Here, by the way, I may mention
that, having weighed hundreds of sovereigns for the sake of a lazy experiment, I
never yet met with two of
exactly the same weight.</p>

<p>A fire-balloon is a
pretty device of itself, but
it becomes much better
worth looking at when it is
made to take up fireworks,
so I will now give some
instructions about these
fireworks. I cannot recommend
you to make the
fireworks yourselves, but
to buy them ready made
and arrange them in suitable
devices. You will
want a few feet of Bickford&#8217;s
fuse, and the same
of quickmatch. Both may
be obtained of Messrs.
Brock, of Cheapside and
the Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>Bickford&#8217;s fuse is much
used by miners for exploding
their charges. For
this purpose it is invaluable,
a given length burning
a given time, so that the
miner knows exactly what
his fuse must be in order
to afford him the time
necessary for escaping to
a safe distance before his
charge goes off. It is invaluable
to you boy balloonists
in another way.
The prettiest balloon firework
effects are those
which are not lighted at the time when you let off your balloon, but which take fire
apparently of themselves after the balloon has gained a considerable elevation.
Bickford&#8217;s fuse enables you to accomplish this in a manner you will soon understand.</p>

<p>Looked at casually, Bickford&#8217;s fuse might be taken for a piece of black cord,
something in size like this (<a href="#FigLIX10">Fig. 10</a>). The outside is of
woven material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
made waterproof. The middle contains an inflammable wick, burning regularly
to time.</p>

<p>If you were to pass through a length of Bickford&#8217;s fuse transversely a thread fixed
at its upper end, and having a weight attached to the other end, and if then you
were to light the fuse at one end, you see what would happen. The fire would
creep along until, coming to the thread, it would burn the latter, and the weight
would fall. It is many years since I had occasion to work with Bickford&#8217;s fuse, so I
forget its rapidity of burning. It does not signify; when you have got your fuse
you can try an experiment with any convenient length, timing the rapidity of
burning by a watch.</p>

<p>Quickmatch consists of a paper tube with a rapidly inflammable wick running
through it, the intention being that flame applied to one end of the match shall flash
to the other, and instantaneously. The actual fireworks I recommend you to get are
some blue-lights, some Roman candles, a few Catherine wheels, crackers, and
maroons. The Roman candles you will only require to pick to pieces for the sake
of the stars they contain, so if you could get the stars you would not want the
candles. Mr. Brock, I think, would supply you with stars of various colours. He
uses small pill-boxes for holding the star material.</p>

<p>I have now to explain to you a few fireworks for your balloon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLIX12">
<img src="images/illo488a.jpg" alt="balloon" width="250" height="245" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 12.</p>
</div>

<p>1. <i>Fixed piece of blue-lights.</i>&mdash;Having selected a cork of suitable size, bore its
circumference with as many holes not going to the middle as you design to have
blue-lights. Each excavation made will receive the blank end of a blue-light, just
as a candlestick receives the end of a candle, so that when finished, supposing you
to have used four blue-lights, you will have made something like this (<a href="#FigLIX12">Fig. 12</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLIX13">
<img src="images/illo488b.jpg" alt="balloon" width="250" height="270" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 13.</p>
</div>

<p>On observing the blue-lights which you have purchased, each will be found to
have attached to it at the burning end a screw of soft paper, usually blue. This I
hardly need tell any English boy is touch-paper, made by saturating soft paper with
solution of nitre and drying. Firework cases are usually finished off with touch-paper,
so that they may ignite immediately. When you send up such an arrangement
of blue-lights as just described, the proposition will be to ignite them all at
once with a flash, and after the lapse of a period of time which must be left to your
own discretion. Quickmatch spread from end to end of each blue-light, and there
secured, either by thread or else a slip of paper pasted loopwise over it, will
accomplish the first, and a suitable length of Bickford&#8217;s fuse the second. All
this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
obvious, but a diagram is given (<a href="#FigLIX13">Fig. 13</a>). Hardly necessary is it to tell you that we
want no car when using this device. A wire being passed through the middle of the
cork hooked at one end, for attachment to hooked cross wires, and bent at the other
end so that it shall not slip through the cork, are also obvious matters.</p>

<p>You will observe that I have represented the quickmatch as actually running
through the Bickford transversely. This is the surest plan in this and all similar
cases, because the walls of the Bickford are so thick that some time must elapse
before they burn quite through. Transverse perforation and stretching out of the
Bickford can easily be done, the walls of the fuse being very tough. Though my
remarks have been directed to blue-lights only, yet obviously the arrangement
applies to any other variety of tint.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLIX14">
<img src="images/illo488c.png" alt="balloon" width="250" height="284" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 14.</p>
</div>

<p>2. <i>Dropping firework devices.</i>&mdash;Some of the prettiest balloon firework effects are
those which do not light until they have separated from the balloon and fallen
through a varying distance, according to your arrangement. I shall not expect to
find that you think it necessary to inquire how all this may be managed after what I
have written about Bickford fuse and quickmatch. However, some few remarks
about a certain convenience of arrangement may not come amiss. Suppose, then,
that you have launched your balloon carrying several devices&mdash;we will assume it to
carry six. You want the first of these devices to part company with the balloon, and
shortly after ignite in falling, all to time. You want the successive five to part
company with the balloon also to time. Obviously a length of Bickford fuse will
accomplish all this, but there are inconvenient as well as convenient ways of
arranging all. A convenient way is this (<a href="#FigLIX14">Fig. 14</a>).</p>

<p>When I have told you this diagram represents a thing made of wire, and you are
so to use it that a fall shall take place at every corner, you will see that all can be
managed by Bickford fuse.</p>

<p>Amongst the fireworks that are effective when thus falling are small blue-lights,
squibs, crackers, maroons, stars, but more especially catherine wheels. All explosive
fireworks give a shock when exploded&mdash;maroons a great shock. Never, then, use a
balloon-attached firework in such manner as that it shall explode whilst attached to the
balloon, the steadiness of which it would certainly affect&mdash;perhaps cause a tongue of
flame to come in contact with the paper and set it on fire. A wirework arrangement
such as our diagram represents is only intended to carry six successive devices, and
for the devices that have been noted you will most likely find that about half-a-dozen
will make up the total weight your balloon can carry. But there are certain lighter
fireworks, of which considerably more than six may be carried; for example, stars.
If you take a star and enclose it in a tissue-paper bag, together with a very little&mdash;say
half a saltspoonful of mealed, or powdered, gunpowder; then, if you tie the mouth
of the bag round a short length of quickmatch, you see what must happen when the
flame of a Bickford fuse sets the free end of the quickmatch alight. You will rig up
the stars with their bags on wire cross-work as already described, but you will arrange
that the successive ignitions follow a spiral course, like that of a loosely-coiled watch
spring.</p>

<p>I think I have told you as much as can be profitable about the making of fire-balloons,
so a few words now about parachutes. People who ascend in the cars of
large balloons sometimes vary the display by cutting connection with the
balloon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
itself when at a certain height, and coming down by aid of a parachute. Parachutes
used on these occasions are somewhat elaborate things, bearing a general resemblance
to an umbrella deprived of its stick and ribs, having a cord attached to the spot where
the terminal of each rib, if present, would have been, these cords all converging to
join at their lower ends with a car.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLIX15">
<img src="images/illo490a.jpg" alt="balloon" width="250" height="224" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 15.</p>
</div>

<p>The parachute I shall describe for your fire-balloons is a more simple affair, and
is made as follows:&mdash;Provide yourself with two sheets of soft whitey-brown paper,
some twine, and some paste. Lay one sheet flat on a table, and then extend
diagonally from corner to corner two lengths of twine which must project at least six
inches beyond each corner. It may be wanted to project even more, but in that
case each cord terminal may be easily lengthened to the desired extent by tying the
necessary additional length of twine to it. Now spread a film of thin paste evenly
by a brush over the sheet of paper and twine, and then close the second sheet of
paper in exact correspondence with the first, as represented in the diagram.</p>

<p>Be particular, in sticking the two sheets of paper together, to avoid formation of
air bubbles. This can only be done by making the pasting together successive and
not instantaneous&mdash;that is to say, do not lay the second sheet of paper flat down
upon the first sheet all
at once, but having
begun to effect the
attachment at any one
edge, follow on deliberately
to the opposite
edge, patting the
two sheets well together
with a soft
pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>The way of using
such a parachute
hardly needs explanation. The projecting lengths of twine having been brought
together, are attached to a car, and the whole suspended to your balloon, from
which you intend that it shall separate and begin to fall, on your balloon attaining
the desired elevation. This detachment can easily be effected by Bickford&#8217;s fuse.
Here, whilst I think of it, never attempt to ignite a Bickford fuse with anything
else than the flame of a port-fire or a blue-light. The chief beauty of any firework
device consists in working to exact time. A Bickford fuse cannot readily be set
on fire with a match-flame. You may crack many lucifers over the job without
succeeding; your balloon, that ought to be off on its travels, all the time kept waiting.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLIX16">
<img src="images/illo490b.jpg" alt="balloon" width="300" height="222" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 16.</p>
</div>

<p>What will you put in the car? I shall leave this pretty much to your own taste.
Some sort of weight there must be to pull the parachute down. I have heard of
some boys who for ornament peopled the car with little figures of comical men, cut
out of cardboard. I don&#8217;t see myself the sense of it. Fire-balloons are usually let
off at night, when the little caricatures would almost need a spyglass to see them
even before the balloon set out on its explorations. Balloons once off nobody could
see the little men at all. However, do as you like, boys; <a href="#FigLIX16">here</a> are two notions of
such caricature men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span></p>

<p>Attention! The point up to which you and I have been working is near. We
are going to let off the balloon. When we were making our chamber trial, you will
remember we used methylated spirit for fuel, absorbing it by a sponge. You may
use the same sort of fuel now if you please, but as for myself I much prefer the good
flare of cotton lamp-wick saturated with tallow, and sprinkled with either benzoline
or turpentine, so that it may burst into flame without delay at the first touch of other
flame. Not only does tallow burn with a far brighter light than spirits of wine, but
the flame is more lasting. However, boys, I say again&mdash;do as you like. So now
farewell to fire-balloons. I will now proceed to tell you how to make and fill so-called
air-balloons, though gas-balloons would be a name more fitting. They are
not of themselves illuminative, as fire-balloons are, but they will take up any
fireworks you please, according to their weight-carrying capabilities.</p>

</div>

<h4 class="lix_iii">III.&mdash;ON GASES AND GAS-BALLOONS.</h4>

<p class="noindent">aving got fire-balloons out of hand, I will now have some
words with you about air-balloons, usually so called,
though &#8216;gas-balloons&#8217; would be a more appropriate designation.
Before describing how to make an air-balloon,
suppose we gossip a little about the science of the thing.</p>

<p>Of gases there are many sorts, as you will become aware
when a little advanced in your chemistry. Atmospheric
air is a mixture of two gases, as probably you know&mdash;four
measures of nitrogen to one of oxygen, roughly speaking;
though were we describing the composition of atmospheric
air in an exhaustive manner, we should have to chronicle
the presence of numerous other gases besides oxygen and
nitrogen, and some vapours; all, however, in quantities so
extremely small that we need take no account of them
here. Some gases are lighter than atmospheric air, some
heavier, but it is evident that those only which are lighter can be employed for
ballooning. The very lightest of all gases is hydrogen, which therefore is the very
best gas for filling balloons. It is seldom now employed, however, coal-gas being
usually substituted, on account of its being ready to hand, so to say, in every place
where coal-gas illumination is practised.</p>

<p>Here, perhaps, some young gentleman will wish to inquire why it is I employ
the ordinary name, coal-gas, instead of a chemical name. The reply is simple.
Coal-gas always means gas from coal, but when I tell my readers that coal-gas has
not necessarily always the same composition, although the same coal be used, they
will see that no unchanging chemical name for it is applicable. According as the
gas retort is heated more or less, so will the resulting gas differ in composition&mdash;not
a difference as to nature of components, but as to quantity. Coal-gas must always
be a combination of carbon with hydrogen, but the amount of carbon to a given
amount of hydrogen may vary within wide limits. If coal-gas be required for illuminative
purposes, the object of manufacture will be to make it as rich in carbon
as possible. Now, the richest gaseous combination of carbon with hydrogen
is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
olefiant gas, but it would be the worst quality of coal-gas for balloon inflation. If
olefiant gas be transmitted through a white-hot iron pipe it expands in volume, thus
showing what would have happened had it originally been produced in a white-hot
iron retort. A gas manager doing duty in one of our seaport towns once told me
that he always managed to have expanded gas&mdash;we may call it adulterated gas&mdash;for
night street service. It was good enough, he explained, for drunken sailors, and
nobody else was about.</p>

<p>Probably you youngsters will generally use coal-gas for filling your balloons, it
being so handy. I would prefer that you did not, but use hydrogen instead, because
not only is the making of hydrogen chemically instructive, but a balloon of given
size will lift at least half as much again as it would if filled with gas from coal taken
as one finds it. Besides, general though the use of coal-gas illumination has become,
it may happen that some boy is staying at a country house where coal-gas is not
available, for all which reasons I shall begin by giving directions for the production
of hydrogen on a sufficiently large scale, and easily.</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">IV.&mdash;HOW TO PREPARE HYDROGEN GAS.</h4>

<p>There are many ways of preparing hydrogen. I shall offer you the choice
between two. Both are equally good, and you will discover for yourselves which is
the easier under your
own special circumstances.
No. 1 consists
in acting upon zinc or
iron&mdash;zinc is best&mdash;with
a mixture of one part of
oil of vitriol, measure,
and six parts of water,
also measure. No. 2
consists in passing steam
through a red-hot iron
pipe, loosely packed
with fragments of iron&mdash;say
iron nails. If oil
of vitriol be available in
the out-of-the-way
country house where you
are assumed to operate,
I recommend you to
follow plan No. 1. So now about the apparatus. Two large wide-mouthed pickle
or preserve bottles, with bungs to match, and a few feet of small leaden gas-pipe,
are all that you will require, and you must arrange your apparatus in the following
fashion. (<a href="#FigLIX01a">Figs. 1 and 2</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLIX01a">
<img src="images/illo492.png" alt="hydrogen production" width="350" height="261" />
<p class="caption">Figs. 1 and 2.</p>
</div>

<p>You will here observe that one bottle is represented as larger than the other.
We may call it the generator. Into it a good handful of zinc fragments having been
put, or in defect of these a handful of small iron nails, and the cork thrust in
tight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
the mixture of oil of vitriol with water is to be poured down the upright tube at <i>a</i>,
which you will observe has been reamed out into a sort of funnel shape by thrusting
into it a conical piece of wood. It is worth while here to remark that though a
large preserve bottle answers very well as a generator, yet a copper vessel answers
much better, the gas development being much faster, on account of a galvanic
condition, due to the contact of copper with zinc, and which on this occasion I do
not consider necessary to write more about.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLIX03a">
<img src="images/illo493.jpg" alt="flower pot" width="300" height="238" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>As for plan No. 2, the representation of which is annexed, it is much more
simple than it looks, as you will gather when I
tell you that the furnace part of the apparatus
need be no more nor less than a flower-pot
having the necessary holes knocked in (<a href="#FigLIX03a">Fig. 3</a>).
Mind, however, to bind your flower-pot with
wire, as it is sure to crack when fuel is first
lighted within it. Let it crack as much as
ever it pleases, your furnace will be none the
worse for present purposes, and that is all you
require.</p>

<p>I dare say you have heard of a dear
departed lady, much respected in her time,
a Mistress Glass. &#8216;First catch your hare,&#8217;
wrote Mistress Glass, when about to give
directions for making hare-soup. First catch, or learn how to catch, your gas, say I.
By this time you know and can judge for yourself which to use, whether hydrogen
pure and simple, or else coal-gas.</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">V.&mdash;THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BALLOON.</h4>

<p>Now about making your balloon. The first question is what you shall make it
of. Large gas-balloons, such as ascend at public exhibitions with a&euml;ronaut travellers,
are usually made of silk, covered with some sort of elastic varnish, though the
material of very large balloons may be calico, linen, or even canvas. The general
statement holds good that in proportion as the balloon is larger so does it admit
of being made coarser and heavier. There is a sound mathematical reason for
this which any sharp boy ought to perceive, and which, if he do not perceive,
I would advise him for his own good to go to his mathematical master and accept
castigation.</p>

<p>When the question was how to make a fire-balloon, solution was easy. Tissue-paper,
plain and simple, leaves for this purpose nothing to be desired. If a few
holes should happen to find themselves in your material, the consequence would not
be very serious, inasmuch as the balloon carries its flame, its hot-air generator, along
with it; but when you come to have one charge of gas, the gas not renewable, you
are obliged to be particular, not merely as to holes, but even loosely packed fibres.</p>

<p>I am entitled to speak magisterially on this point, having recently had some professional
talk over the matter with Mr. Brock, the pyrotechnist. &#8216;Gold-beater&#8217;s skin
is the very best material for small balloons,&#8217; was that gentleman&#8217;s remark to
me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
&#8216;but it is very expensive. I want to be able to use paper, and every sort of varnish
I have tried has been attended with very indifferent success.&#8217; Mr. Brock went on
to say that anybody who might succeed in rendering tissue-paper effectively gas-proof
might make a fortune. Now I do not believe in the fortune-making part of
the business at all, but I think I shall presently be able to tell you how to make
tissue-paper effectively gas-proof. I say <i>effectively</i>, because I know that no varnished
silk, cotton, or even canvas material&mdash;all used for making balloons&mdash;ever is gas-proof.
If you fill the thickest ox-bladder you can get with hydrogen or coal-gas, tie
the neck of it, and varnish the bladder into the bargain, still gas will come out and
atmospheric air will go in. By simply looking at the closed bladder you would not
fancy this had happened, because the bladder seems plump and well distended, but
were you incautiously to allow a small jet of the contained gas to escape, and to
ignite the jet, the whole bladder would explode with a loud report. Now neither
hydrogen nor coal-gas will explode when unmixed with oxygen; it simply burns.</p>

<p>Having got the necessary sheets of tissue-paper, hold each of them successively
between your eye and a bright light, which will disclose any absolute holes, should
such exist. Having discovered them, your first care must be to stop them, and
this you do by a plaster of tissue-paper smeared with solution of india-rubber in
benzoline. I shall give you no proportions for this solution, but leave you to
rule-o&#8217;-thumb guidance. Having charged a wide-mouthed bottle&mdash;a pickle-bottle
does quite well-about half full with benzoline, put into it piece after piece of
india-rubber&mdash;not vulcanised rubber, mind, which will not dissolve in benzoline,
but raw rubber, and keep adding rubber, bit by bit, stirring occasionally with a
table knife until you get a paste, not too thick for spreading with a knife-blade.
The solution will not be complete for some days. With this, when complete, smear
a breadth of tissue-paper, and consider it your plaster.</p>

<p>Remember well the following injunction. In any case when you desire to stick
together two surfaces with this india-rubber cement, both surfaces must be smeared,
as it does not suffice to smear only one. The next injunction is a very peculiar
one, and would not be likely to come self-suggested. Do not bring the surfaces
together whilst the solution is wet. Let your work stand until evaporation of the
solvent benzoline has left the surfaces what may be called dry. Thus you see the
working with this india-rubber paste is the very reverse of working with all ordinary
sticking materials.</p>

<p>Repeat the plastering on of solution at least twice, and plaster thick; the result
is thin enough when dry. Having in this manner stopped the holes, proceed
to make the paper gas-proof. For this purpose you will need a special solution,
made in this wise:&mdash;To a pint of benzoline add an ounce of solid paraffin&mdash;some
of a paraffin candle, for example&mdash;and a drachm of raw, not vulcanised, rubber.
When the two have dissolved, which will require some days&#8217; waiting, lay your
tissue-paper on a table, and by means of a flat varnish-brush spread the solution all
over it. Wait till evaporation leaves the paper dry, then repeat the operation up
to six times, when the paper will have been rendered sufficiently gas-proof for
making a balloon. You are to cut this out into fillets, just as you did when
making a fire-balloon, and you are to stick the fillets together with the cement
already described, remembering well the two injunctions already given. You
are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
not restricted to shape as you are in fire-balloon making, but may adopt any shape,
remembering, however, that to promote convenience of gas-collection, the balloon
neck should be much narrower than that of a fire-balloon; tubular, so to speak, a
tube of one inch diameter being quite sufficient. The reason for making a narrow
tubular neck will be apparent from study of the accompanying <a href="#FigLIX01b">diagram</a>. It will
be evident to you that on account of the narrow neck the mode of car,
or weight attachment, cannot be similar to that adopted in the case of
fire-balloons. The neatest and, at the same time, most obvious plan
of procedure is that adopted in large balloons, by throwing a net, with
strings dependent, over the whole balloon, and attaching the car or
other weights to the pendent strings. Such elaborate work is, however,
quite unnecessary in toy balloons. A length of cord tied round
the neck and allowed to hang down affords every necessary facility for
further attachment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLIX01b">
<img src="images/illo495.jpg" alt="balloon" width="150" height="333" />
</div>

<p>Now as regards what the balloon shall take up, that must be for
your own taste to decide. All the resources of pyrotechny are open
to you, and by discreet use of Bickford&#8217;s fuse and quickmatch you
may get innumerable combinations. One of the most brilliant pyrotechnic devices
is the ignition of a tuft of magnesium fillet; but it is somewhat expensive, and, if
carried out, will make a hole in your pocket-money. All the magnesium balloons I
have seen had the magnesium tuft ignited before the balloon was let off; but were
it desired that the magnesium should only commence burning when the balloon had
got some way upon it, nothing would be more easy. All that is necessary to do
would be to wet the magnesium tuft with resin dissolved in benzoline, and then,
whilst still wet, dust it over with mealed gunpowder. On drying, this prepared tuft
will burst into flame on the slightest provocation. If you do not know how to effect
this by judicious employment of Bickford fuse and quickmatch, I shall have written
to small purpose.</p>

<p>The following hint is well worthy attention by such of you young gentlemen as
are not overburdened with pocket-money. Fine zinc shavings will burn, and emit
a bright light something after the style of magnesium, and may be procured at any
zinc-worker&#8217;s for a mere trifle. A moderately brilliant effect may be got out of a tuft
of zinc shavings well dusted with resin and mealed powder whilst made wet with
benzoline. If you don&#8217;t expect too much out of this zinc-burning expedient, perhaps
you will not be disappointed; but at any rate I have not commended the alternative
to you very warmly. Of course, a portion of magnesium may be mixed up with the
zinc shaving tuft, to the latter&#8217;s advantage, just as it has been experimentally proved
that flint soup is all the better for a portion of onion and carrot, and better still for
a portion of meat, peppered and salted.</p>

<p>Before concluding let me just hint at a very effective possibility in the way of
pyrotechnic device, equally applicable to both fire and gas balloons, but which I
have never known carried into practice. You will see that it is a main object in
balloon pyrotechny to make a balloon carry the greatest amount of pyrotechnic
effects using the minimum of weight. Thus, supposing it were desired to cause a
succession of explosions, each equalling in noise the discharge of a forty-pounder
cannon, large maroons would give such a noise, but no toy balloon would
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
competent to lift the maroons. Now a mixture of two volumes hydrogen with one
of oxygen yields an explosive mixture of tremendous violence. Even a small soap-bubble
blown with this mixture and fired is deafening. I have no doubt that an
ox bladder filled with this mixture and ignited would make a report equal to that
of a forty-pounder gun. Several such bladders might be sent up with a very small
toy balloon, and might be detached by means already described, so as to explode
whilst falling. The exact <i>modus operandi</i> would be as follows:&mdash;Take a blue-light,
and with a bradawl make a few transverse holes just above the sealing-wax closure;
then smear the closed and transversely perforated end with a paste of mealed powder
and water. After drying the neck of the bladder already charged with mixed oxygen
and hydrogen, it is to be tightly bound down upon the blue-light, thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo496.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="377" />
</div>

<p>Bickford fuse and quickmatch would easily enable you to achieve the rest, supposing
you to have given proper attention to preceding instructions.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LX.&mdash;MODEL BALLOONS AND ALL ABOUT THEM.<br />
<span class="smcap">By a Professional A&euml;ronaut and Balloon-maker.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">lthough balloon ascents are now matters of everyday
occurrence, and scarcely a <i>f&ecirc;te</i> takes place at any of the
public gardens without the announcement of an ascent to
be conducted by some well-known a&euml;ronaut, yet there are
very few people who really know anything practical about
balloons or their construction, so we often read graphic
descriptions of perils surmounted and deeds of heroism
performed by a&euml;rial travellers, which a&euml;ronauts know to be
utter impossibilities&mdash;such, for instance, as the climbing to
the top of a balloon by the network in order to open the
valve at the top and allow the gas to escape; not to mention
other marvellous fictions invented by the imaginations
of &#8216;sensational&#8217; newspaper reporters.</p>

<p>It is my desire in the present chapter to give the reader a
thorough practical knowledge of that truly wonderful machine
by means of which man is enabled to rise above his
mother earth, and gaze upon her beauties from a height
unattainable otherwise. And, as it is first of all necessary
to dispel the ignorance which prevails upon the subject, I shall commence by
showing what a balloon <i>is not</i>, then I shall proceed to describe what it is, and finally
I hope to give such information as shall enable my readers themselves to construct
a perfect model of a balloon, such as, if made on a proportionately increased scale,
would be capable of carrying into the air one, ten, or twenty people.</p>

<p>That the science of a&euml;rial navigation has a strong fascination for adventurous
dispositions is a proposition which none will gainsay; and the very danger attending
a balloon ascent adds to its pleasurable excitement. This danger, however, is not
only, nor even chiefly in the air, but in the descent to the earth, when the greatest
caution has to be observed to alight upon a favourable spot: and sometimes consists
in the reception accorded to the traveller on his arrival upon <i>terra firma</i>, as the
following little adventure will show.</p>

<p>I have been from my childhood a lover of ballooning, having been, I might
almost say, born to the business, which was taught me by my godfather, the veteran
a&euml;ronaut, Charles Green, whose memory is yet held in reverence by many who knew
and loved him while he lived. I had frequently been taken by him in his various
ascents, and as I grew into man&#8217;s estate I was able to be useful to him in his trips.
On one occasion an ascent had been announced from what were then known as the
Surrey Zoological Gardens. Everything was duly prepared, the balloon was filled
with gas, and at the appointed time Mr. Green and I sailed gently into the
sky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
amid the crash of the band and the cheering of the people, which grew fainter and
yet more faint, and at last quite inaudible, as we mounted higher and higher towards
the azure vault above us.</p>

<p>It was a lovely afternoon in October, and a gentle breeze wafted us slowly
away from the mighty city, over green fields wherein the grazing cattle looked
rather smaller than ants, over villages whose toiling inhabitants seemed but
tiny specks in the universe; until at length a light mist spread itself over the
country.</p>

<p>My relative, experienced a&euml;ronaut though he was, manifested signs of anxiety
as to the safety of our descent; for we had for some time past commenced descending
by letting out the gas from the valve at the top of the balloon, but the
nearer we approached the earth the denser became the fog, while the shades of
evening warned us that the descent was an imperative necessity. Hoping to alight
in the open country, we let fall the grapnel, which very speedily caught hold of
<i>something</i> which checked our progress. Unluckily this <i>something</i> proved to be a
tree, and not the earth, as we had, of course, hoped it would be.</p>

<p>&#8216;Charlie,&#8217; said Mr. Green, &#8216;there is only one thing to be done, and that is for
you to get down and release the grapnel from the tree, and ascertain if you can how
far we are from the open, for if the net gets entangled with the boughs we shall be
lost, and the balloon spoiled.&#8217;</p>

<p>To me, well versed as I was in all kinds of gymnastics, it was a matter of little
difficulty to descend the rope which connected us in some way with the earth; so
putting another stout cord on my shoulder I went down &#8216;hand over hand&#8217; until I
found myself in a large elm-tree, and as the fog had risen considerably above the
earth I was able to make out our whereabouts. We were in the middle of a thickly
wooded park, though about two hundred yards to the east, in the direction in which
we had drifted, I could see a large open space eminently fitted for the descent. I
called out this information, cheerily adding that there was no fear of the net being
broken this time. Then I quickly disengaged the grapnel, upon which the balloon
sprang up gaily into the air, and next prepared to make my own descent from the
tree by means of the cord with which I had provided myself. No sooner had my
feet touched the ground than I felt myself roughly seized by two men, who bound
my arms behind me in a jiffy, and at once commenced to rate me soundly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah!&#8217; said the elder man, savagely, &#8216;we&#8217;ve caught you at last, you rascal, have
we? So you&#8217;re the chap as steals our governor&#8217;s pheasants, is it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; grinned the other, &#8216;and it&#8217;s with a net as you takes &#8217;em, just as I thought!
We&#8217;ll see what the squire&#8217;ll say to you now!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But, my good friends,&#8217; I observed, &#8216;you have made a mistake. I&#8217;m not a
poacher, but have just come down from a balloon, and shall be very much obliged
to you if you will help me to secure it when it descends again, as it will, away from
the trees.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ha! ha! ha! Ho! ho! ho!&#8217; roared my captors, &#8216;that won&#8217;t do for us, young
master. There ain&#8217;t no b&#8217;loon up that there tree; but what there is there is your
pal with the net what you catches the pheasants with; and,&#8217; raising his voice, &#8216;he
may as well come down at once, &#8216;cos we means nabbing him now we knows where
he is.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>

<p>Some passing labourers were hailed and stationed round the tree to await the
descent of &#8216;the other poacher,&#8217; while I, whose remonstrances were of no avail, was
hurried up to &#8216;the house,&#8217; wherein sat, on his chair of state, the redoubtable &#8216;squire,&#8217;
to whom the domain belonged, and whose pheasants I was accused of stealing.
Again I told the story of the balloon. The old gentleman regarded me with stern
dignity, and, wagging his finger at me, solemnly inquired of the keepers (my captors)
whether they had seen any balloon. Upon receiving a reply in the negative, he
assumed his most magisterial demeanour.</p>

<p>&#8216;Young man,&#8217; he said, &#8216;it is sad indeed to find a person of education in your
unfortunate position. Your tale of having come down in a balloon is as audacious
as it is ridiculous. No balloon was seen by my servants, and you were seen to
descend a tree, your companion remaining no doubt until the hue and cry should
be passed. I have lost many pheasants lately, and there can be no doubt now
as to who the culprits have been. I have nothing more to do now than to
commit you for to-night to the lock-up, and the case will be investigated in the
morning.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But, sir,&#8217; I pleaded, &#8216;pray send to the field just outside your park, where my
friend will doubtless be found by this time with his balloon, which could not be
seen by your keepers on account of the fog, but which was then hovering above the
tree in which the grapnel had caught, and from which I extricated it.&#8217;</p>

<p>Happily for me this request was acceded to, and in due course Mr. Green made
his appearance and corroborated my statement, upon which every attention was
lavished upon us both. We received an invitation to dinner, and, instead of passing
the night in a village cell, I slept on the bed of down of our most jovial and
courteous host, who would not hear of our leaving him until we had enjoyed a good
night&#8217;s rest under his hospitable roof.</p>

<p>But I am in very great danger of forgetting that my present intention is to
write a practical treatise, not to prattle about my adventures, so I will set myself
seriously to work at once; and will begin by showing in a few words what a balloon
<i>is not</i>.</p>

<p>In the first place, a balloon is most certainly not what it is sometimes erroneously
called&mdash;a flying machine. One might as well compare the gracefulness of a good
swimmer with the aimless floating of a dead dog, as to pretend that the helpless
drifting of a balloon has anything in common with the as yet only partially
accomplished science of a&euml;rial flight. What, then, is a balloon, and how is it constructed?</p>

<p>A balloon for carrying passengers consists of a certain number of gores cut in
such a form that when they are sewn together they form a perfect sphere, the lower
part or neck being elongated, which gives a pear-shaped appearance. This elongation
at the neck is made in order to allow the gas to pass freely into the balloon
during inflation. On the top is placed a valve, which is a circular double door
composed of two semicircles. To each of these semicircular openings is attached a
line, which, meeting a little lower down, form one line, which passes through the
centre of the balloon, and comes out at the neck; so that when the a&euml;ronaut
desires to descend he lets out the gas by pulling the line. The doors open inwards,
and close themselves by means of springs with which they are fitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p>The balloon itself is composed of very fragile materials. It is merely a gas-holder,
and is nowadays almost invariably made of fine cambric well varnished.
Silk was the first-used material, but it is a needless expense. Thus it will be seen
that the balloon itself has practically no strength in it whatever. All the space,
however, and the pressure of the gas, are held in by a netting, which covers the
whole of the balloon, to which it is fitted exactly, being shaped from the original
pattern gore of the balloon itself&mdash;to be fully described hereafter.</p>

<p>Just below the neck of the balloon is a <span class="smcapall">HOOP</span>, to which all the netting lines are
fastened. This hoop is made of ash, and is about three feet in diameter, all the
strain of the balloon being concentrated at this point.</p>

<p>Below the hoop is attached the <span class="smcapall">CAR</span>, which is a large wicker basket suspended
from the hoop by eight cords&mdash;technically termed car lines; and fastened to the
hoop is a strong rope, generally made of flax, about 100 feet in length, which
carries the anchor, or &#8216;grappling-iron,&#8217; as it is called by a&euml;ronauts. This &#8216;grapnel&#8217;
differs in appearance from an ordinary anchor in that it has five prongs instead of
only two. Inside the car are placed several canvas bags containing sifted sand,
which is used as ballast, to regulate the ascending power of the balloon. The car
also contains a few other requisites, notably a &#8216;liberating iron&#8217; for letting the
balloon go when all is reported ready, and an aneroid barometer, to show the altitude
attained, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Before entering upon the detailed description of how to make your model
balloon, I think it will be well to give some idea of what an ordinary ascent really
is, for it is of importance that we should realise what we are about before we proceed
to construct the machine which is to carry us from the nether atmosphere into
unknown regions miles above the earth, whether the ascent is to be made for
scientific purposes or merely for amusement. I do not think there are many living
men who can give better instruction on this point than myself, seeing that I have
already made no less than eighty-four ascents, while I hope to make as many more
before old age and infirmity put a stop to my ballooning career.</p>

<p>Balloons constructed to carry passengers vary very much in size, the smallest
being of 18,000 cubic feet capacity, capable of raising two people only&mdash;the a&euml;ronaut
and one passenger. This, or a little larger, is the size of the balloon now generally
used, larger balloons being made principally for scientific purposes. Such a one
was the celebrated &#8216;Mammoth,&#8217; supplied by Mr. Coxwell for the memorable investigations
by Mr. Glaisher about the year 1863, of which I suppose you may probably
have heard, and concerning which it may interest you to learn that on two of their
ascents I had the honour of accompanying those famous a&euml;ronauts, the ascents
taking place on both occasions from the Crystal Palace, and the descents once at
Singlewell, near Gravesend, and once near Woking.</p>

<p>The gas with which an ordinary balloon is filled is the gas supplied by the gas
companies for street and house lighting, which is called carburetted hydrogen. Pure
hydrogen is seldom employed for balloon inflation, though it may be interesting to
state that the big captive balloon at the Paris Exhibition was initiated with pure
hydrogen, manufactured with sulphuric acid, zinc, and water. This is called
sulphuretted hydrogen, and possesses nearly double the lifting power of coal-gas. A
balloon held down by a rope requires great ascending power, therefore all
captive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
balloons should be inflated with pure hydrogen. The very great expense of this
gas, however, prevents its use in ordinary cases.</p>

<p>The balloon being filled with gas, the a&euml;ronaut and his passenger take their
seats in the car, ready to ascend. The first thing to be done is to untie the neck of
the balloon, which has been fastened up with a piece of string or a handkerchief since
the hose-pipe was removed, when the balloon was quite inflated. The object of
having the neck of the balloon wide open is this: Directly the balloon rises expansion
takes place, owing to the rarefied state of the atmosphere, and the higher it
ascends the more rarefied the air becomes, and consequently the less atmospheric
pressure is there upon the balloon, the natural result being that the gas expands,
and makes its way by degrees out of the neck. If there were no such escape, the
balloon would burst. When the neck is wide open, those in the car can see into
the middle of the balloon, which has a very curious appearance.</p>

<p>We are now supposed to be ready for starting, there having been placed at the
bottom of the car several more bags of ballast than are known to be required.
These are handed out, one by one, until the weight in the car is about equal to or
a little lighter than the ascending power of the balloon. Then the a&euml;ronaut, feeling
himself master of the situation, calls out in a loud voice, &#8216;All hands off!&#8217; At the
word of command the assistants, who have been keeping the car down, leave go
their hold, and the balloon rises slowly and majestically into the air. (Please now
to put yourself into the place of the passenger making his first ascent, with eyes and
ears open to take in all the instruction that can be conveyed to him.)</p>

<p>When about fifteen feet in the air the passenger, who has by this time probably
worked himself into a somewhat feverish state of excitement, is astonished and considerably
alarmed by a sudden jerk or shock, and the equally sudden arrest of the
balloon in its upward journey. The fact is that we had not finally left our mother
earth, but have been pulled down again by a rope, held by the assistants, which was
attached to the hoop by an instrument called the &#8216;liberating iron.&#8217; The a&euml;ronaut
himself lets the balloon take its final departure when he touches a lever attached to
the liberating iron, and we are being pulled down again on the present occasion
because it is found that we have too much ascending power, and can take in
another half bag ballast; and the more ballast a balloon can carry the better, as
sometimes ballast is found to be worth its weight in gold&mdash;or rather, worth as much
more as life is worth more than the most precious of all earthly possessions. At the
risk of fatiguing you by a digression, I will explain how this is.</p>

<p>The use of ballast is in getting rid of it. When the a&euml;ronaut desires to descend
he pulls the line I have before described, letting the gas out of the valve at the top,
when the balloon immediately comes down. Perhaps unfavourable weather, with a
strong wind, may have arisen, and he suddenly sees beneath him a village, or a barn,
or perhaps he has been borne out to sea. In any of these cases almost certain death
would be the result of a sudden descent. So he throws some ballast out of the car,
which immediately lightens it, and the balloon rises up again and carries him over
the danger to some place where the descent may be made in safety. If all the
ballast be injudiciously or prematurely expended, there is danger indeed in
descending; and I know of one instance, at least, in which a daring but unskilful
a&euml;ronaut was killed, who, in all human probability, would have been now living
if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
had had with him but one more bag of ballast. So, you see, I do not exaggerate
when I say that ballast is sometimes worth much more than its weight in gold.</p>

<p>To return to our ascent. Having taken on board the extra ballast, &#8216;All hands
off!&#8217; is again called out aloud; again we ascend into the air, the band strikes up,
the guns are fired, the a&euml;ronaut, his hand upon the liberating iron, salutes the public,
the rope is detached, and we are off!</p>

<p>And now I will leave my passenger gazing over the side of the car, lost in amazement
at the grandeur of the scene beneath him, as the horizon, rising with our ascent,
discloses to view an expanse of country of which he could have had no previous
conception; for I have work to do. First, I look at the aneroid barometer and find
that we have arrived at an altitude of about three thousand feet, which is the height
usually attained in an ordinary ascent. The gas has been coming out of the neck
very freely, and the balloon is consequently beginning to descend. As we do not
intend to land just yet, however, it is necessary to check the descent by parting with
a little ballast, which is thrown out over the edge of the car, and has the appearance
of smoke as it passes into space.</p>

<p>Now we are about the same weight as the atmosphere with which we are travelling.
Although there was only a slight breeze on the surface of the earth, the upper
current is considerably stronger, and we are going along with the clouds at a speed
of a little less than a mile a minute. Yet, though travelling at this rate, we appear
to be in a dead calm, and if a feather be dropped from the car it will sink slowly in
a perpendicular line underneath us. When a balloon has left the earth there is no
perceptible motion in it whatever. We seem to be stationary, while the fields have
the appearance of rushing quickly along beneath us. We are really, as it were,
part and parcel of the air, and as the current moves so we drift with it, like a cork
on a running stream; and if it were possible to put you blindfold into the car of a
balloon, you might be taken up into the clouds and brought down again without your
being any the wiser&mdash;indeed, without your knowing anything at all about the
journey.</p>

<p>This I have been telling you while we have been sailing along through the beautiful
summer sky, taking in deep gulps of the pure air, and looking down and around
upon the glorious moving panorama. But now I must leave you again to your own
resources, for it is time that we should prepare for the descent, and I require to have
all my wits about me. The grapnel, which is hooked on to the edge of the car, is
lowered down by the rope, which is 100 feet in length, and firmly fastened to the
hoop. Now we must exercise judgment and caution in selecting a proper place on
which to make our descent by looking along the earth in the direction in which we
are travelling. We must not come down among the crops, or we shall have the
farmer after us for damages. The trees are particularly dangerous, as we have seen.
So are the telegraph wires, for even if they should not destroy us, it would go hard
with us in the Law Courts if we were to damage them. An a&euml;ronaut must thus
have his eyes wide open, and be able to see some miles in front of him; and he
must try to make for some open park or pasture land, which he can distinguish from
land on which crops are growing by the cattle grazing. So the valve is opened a
little, with the immediate effect of causing the balloon to descend to from 1000 to
500 feet above the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span></p>

<p>Now we pass rapidly over the country until we arrive over the selected spot,
when, giving the valve another stout pull, the balloon obeys and drops. Perhaps, on
a closer inspection, the place we have chosen is not so favourable as it appeared at
a distance; then, of course, we have to part with a bag of ballast, and ascend again
until we reach a more suitable alighting ground. The grapnel takes hold at last,
and on a calm day the balloon may be brought down as lightly as a feather by
the regulating of the ballast; but when there is a strong current of air the grapnel
will sometimes trail, which causes the balloon to jerk unpleasantly, but with good
management there is no danger.</p>

<p>Having thus taken you up, and brought you safely down again, I will redeem the
promise I make in the title by showing you</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">How to make a Model Balloon</span>,</h4>

<p class="noindent">which, simple as it may seem, is in reality a very intricate operation, and you will
find, as you follow me, that there is a great deal to be learned. I do not fancy you
will think it at all dull work, however; on the contrary, while it is instructive and
scientific, it will afford you many hours&#8217; agreeable and innocent amusement. You
have been taught how to make yachts, and have been very delighted, I have no doubt,
when your first attempt at shipbuilding has proved successful, and you have seen
your ship float upon the water and carry sail; but I do not think there are many
readers who have had the opportunity of learning how to make a balloon which will
actually hold gas and ascend into the air. Perhaps you will find this latter part of
my treatise rather technical, yet I hope you will give it your attention, for I am about
to endeavour to let you know more about this subject than has ever been written
upon it before; and though I do not expect, or wish, to make you all professional
a&euml;ronauts, I do certainly desire to awaken in your minds an interest in ballooning&mdash;a
science which is daily becoming of more recognised importance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLX01">
<img src="images/illo503a.png" alt="balloon" width="450" height="84" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>In making a balloon the first thing to be done is to take into consideration how
many gores, or strips, will be required to form a balloon of any given diameter. For
instance, if a balloon be required of the circumference of 3 feet, there will be twelve
gores each 18 inches in length (that being half the circumference), and 3 inches
in width at the equator, but tapering at each extremity, as will be hereafter described.
Now divide the paper of the pattern gore into four equal parts, and then describe a
circle in the centre (<a href="#FigLX01">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLX02">
<img src="images/illo503b.jpg" alt="balloon" width="450" height="113" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>

<p>Divide one quadrant of the circle into any given number of parts&mdash;say seventeen.
Then drop perpendiculars parallel with line C from each point of the divisions,
intersecting line B in the quadrant. Now divide line B from centre of circle to end
of pattern in seventeen equal parts, and raise perpendiculars from each point of
division, as in <a href="#FigLX02">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLX03">
<img src="images/illo504a.png" alt="balloon" width="450" height="111" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>Next draw horizontal lines, or measure off with compasses from each point of
division in the quadrant, cutting or intersecting the seventeen corresponding lines as
shown, and with a free hand, or by the aid of a French curve, connect all these points
together, as shown in <a href="#FigLX03">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

<p>Having now got a quarter of the pattern, it must be cut round, as shown, and
transferred to the three other quarters,
marked respectively in the figure A, B, C,
which will be the pattern for a sphere. This
is technically known as striking out a
pattern gore by an intersection of lines, and
this is quite near enough for the paper
balloons, on which you must practise until
you are sufficiently advanced in the science
to enable you to begin on the proper
material. There is another method which
is still more accurate, in fact, will ensure
absolute mathematical correctness, and that
is by a calculation of a series of decimals
corresponding with each of the seventeen
perpendicular lines shown beneath (<a href="#FigLX04">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLX04">
<img src="images/illo504b.png" alt="balloon" width="185" height="550" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.</p>
</div>

<p>Suppose, for example, that the diameter
of the balloon to be constructed is 20 ft.,
and that it is required to make it of 12
pieces; then, in order to draw the pattern
for those pieces, find the circumference of
the balloon, which is 62&middot;83 ft., and, dividing
it by 4, the quotient is 15&middot;7 ft. Make, therefore,
A D equal to 15&middot;7 ft., and D E likewise
of the same length. Divide the circumference,
62&middot;83 ft., by 24, which is double the
number of pieces that are to form the
balloon, and the quotient, 2&middot;618 ft., is the
length of D C, and likewise of B D, so that
B C is equal to 5&middot;236 ft. Then, having
divided the line A D into 18 equal parts,
and having drawn the parallel lines from those
points of division, find the length of each
of those lines by multiplying 2&middot;618 by the
decimals annexed to that line. Thus 2&middot;618,
multiplied by 0&middot;99619, gives 2&middot;608 ft. for the
length of <i>f g</i>, and, again multiplying 2&middot;618
by 0&middot;98481, the result gives 2&middot;578 ft. for the
length of <i>h i</i>, and so of the rest. In cutting the pieces after such a pattern, care
should be taken to leave them about three-quarters of an inch all round wider than
the pattern, which will be taken up by the seams; and the same rule must be
borne in mind whether you are experimenting upon paper patterns, or upon
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
materials required for a large balloon. <a href="#FigLX04">Fig. 4</a> will illustrate the foregoing instruction,
and those who like to take the trouble to prove the sum will take all the more
interest in the manufacture of their balloon.</p>

<p>These decimals have been calculated by a mathematician, and are available for
any sized balloon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLX05">
<img src="images/illo504c.png" alt="balloon" width="85" height="550" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 5.</p>
</div>

<p>Now we come to the neck, the pattern of which may be drawn with a free hand, and
maybe left to your own fancy, with this proviso&mdash;that the length ought not to exceed
more than one-fifth of the whole length of the pattern. In <a href="#FigLX05">Fig. 5</a> you will see what
the neck should be, the dotted line showing the spherical portion of the pattern gore.</p>

<p>Small gas-balloons are generally made of tissue-paper, varnished over with boiled
oil, which gives them a very transparent and skin-like effect. Sometimes gold-beater&#8217;s
skin is used, but it is very expensive, and paper answers the same purpose.
Supposing that you are about to begin upon a paper balloon, the first thing to be
done, before making your pattern gore, is of course to select your paper. Ordinary
tissue is manufactured from the size of 20 &times; 30 inches square. There are other
sizes made of a stronger quality, suitable for larger balloons than that of three
feet circumference, upon which I recommend you to practise, as this is a handy
size, while the above-sized paper&mdash;obtainable everywhere&mdash;cuts in well for the
width to make the pattern gore, though, for length, you will have, probably, to
paste two sheets together.</p>

<p>When you have a sufficient number of lengths ready for cutting out, place
them, one on the top of another, on a flat board; then place the pattern gore
on the top, and, with a sharp knife or razor, cut the whole out at once, taking care
not to cut the pattern gore. You will do well also to place a few weights on the
top to keep the whole lot in place. After you have cut one edge, move your
pattern about a quarter of an inch away from the edge that is cut. This is to
allow for the &#8216;lap,&#8217; as it is called, whether in pasting a small balloon or sewing
a large one, for bringing the gores together in case you have not made such
allowance on the pattern. In pasting together&mdash;in the case of paper balloons, or
sewing in the case of larger balloons&mdash;you should take care, for the sake of effect, to
do so in alternate colours. Red and white, yellow and white, green and black,
all make effective contrasts, but these minor details may be safely left to your own
taste. Paste them, first in pairs, then in fours, &amp;c., in the following manner.
Having provided yourself with a large, smooth pasteboard, begin by laying upon it
a white gore, and then place carefully over it a coloured one, showing the &#8216;lap&#8217; on
the one underneath to allow for the folding. You can do this by carefully
manipulating the gores with the fingers, or, still better, by the means of a palette or
any other flat knife. Then, with a &#8216;dabber,&#8217; as it is technically termed&mdash;a clean
duster will answer the purpose&mdash;press down the overlapping seam the whole length,
and immediately hang it up to dry, and proceed to do the same thing with the
others, never attempting to paste others together until the first are perfectly secure by
drying. A little alum should be put into the paste you are using for the purpose.</p>

<p>When you have pasted all the gores together, <i>and they are quite dry</i>, blow the
balloon out with a pair of bellows through the neck. You will find at the top,
where all the points of the gores meet, a small hole, which will let out the air with
which you have filled your balloon, and <i>&agrave; fortiori</i> the gas with which it will have
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
be filled presently, the gas being lighter than the air, and so more anxious to make
its escape from its imprisonment. At all events this is very probable, even in the
most carefully and scientifically constructed balloons. To obviate this fatal mistake,
therefore, you must cut a round piece of paper, which is called the cap, answering
to the valve in a real balloon, and carefully paste it over the meeting-places of
the various gores. For you must bear in mind that a balloon is not a balloon at
all unless it be perfectly air-tight.</p>

<p>Now let out the air by gentle pressure, and fold up the balloon, gore over gore,
and commence the varnishing, which is laid on as thinly as possible with a
small piece of flannel. The varnish used is simply boiled oil, which can be
obtained from any oil and colour shop. After you have carefully varnished the
whole of the gores, blow the balloon out again, and hang it up by the neck
until it is dry, a process which will take about twelve hours.</p>

<p>The material used in the construction of balloons for carrying passengers is
Scotch cambric&mdash;not silk, as is erroneously supposed. Silk has not been largely
used in the manufacture of balloons for the last forty years, and I need hardly
say that it is not pasted, as in a paper balloon, but sewn with double rows of
stitches, and varnished exactly in the same manner as I have already described.</p>

<p>In big balloons, the most important part of all is</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">THE NETTING.</h4>

<p class="noindent">And I shall now describe the way in which, if you desire to make your model
perfect, you must set about this portion of your manufacture, which,
however, you can dispense with if you please in a paper gas-balloon.
As I told you before, there is scarcely any strain whatever on the
balloon; in fact you could make a large paper balloon to contain
20,000 cubic feet of gas, and if it were covered with a properly fitting
net it would, for one ascent, answer the same purpose as a cambric
balloon, the reason for making it of a material at once light and strong
being to enable it to stand the wear and tear of laying out, folding,
packing, &amp;c. The first thing to be observed in making the net of a
balloon is to take the same pattern gore as the balloon itself was cut
from. Now draw a longitudinal line through the centre <span class="smcapall">A</span> (<a href="#FigLX06">Fig. 6</a>),
the gore being reduced to two halves. Divide one half by the same
rule as that on which you originally cut the pattern gore, the object
of this division being to get the meshes of the intended
netting reduced to such a small scale that four meshes
may cover each gore. Measure on the centre line <span class="smcapall">A</span>, the
distance <span class="smcapall">B C</span>, and half as long again. Draw a line
parallel to <span class="smcapall">B C</span> from <span class="smcapall">D</span> to <span class="smcapall">E</span>.</p>

<div class="figc285">

<div class="figleft" id="FigLX06">

<p class="caption">Fig. 6</p>

<div class="figright" id="FigLX07">
<img src="images/illo506b.png" alt="balloon" width="132" height="550" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7</p>
</div>

</div><!--figc285-->

<p>Now draw a diagonal line from <span class="smcapall">D</span> to <span class="smcapall">C</span>, which will give
you an angle of about sixty degrees. Now cut a templet
or set square out of card or thin wood, corresponding
with angle <span class="smcap">C B D</span>, thus (<a href="#FigLX07">Fig. 7</a>).</p>

<p>Now with line <span class="smcapall">F G</span> on the templet corresponding with line <span class="smcapall">D E</span> in
<a href="#FigLX06">Fig. 6</a>, draw <span class="smcapall">E F</span>, and
continue this until you come to the crown&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the part
where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
the valve is fixed. Now draw diagonal lines, similar to <span class="smcapall">B E</span>, all the way up (as shown
in <a href="#FigLX06">Fig. 6</a>), which gives the different sizes of the meshes to be used in forming the
net from the equator to the pole; and supposing you have decided to have twelve
gores to form your balloon, you would then have forty-eight rows of meshes to go
round the balloon, and so on, according to the number of gores of which the balloon
is composed.</p>

<p>Now for making the netting from the equator to the hoop, concerning which
the following instructions are to be observed. The first set, or row, of meshes
below the equator are to be of the same length as those at the equator with one-fourth
added&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> one-quarter longer; the second set, or row, of meshes from the
equator are to be one-quarter longer than the last; the third set from the equator
to be one-third longer than the second set; the fourth set one-third longer than the
third set; the fifth set, or row, is called the drawing line, and is one-third longer
than the last. Then come the cords, or leading lines, which are fastened to the
hoop, to which the car is attached. This is the true way to make a proper balloon
net, and on the same principles you may make the meshes much larger by setting
them out three to the gore instead of four&mdash;indeed, they are often made in this
manner for economy&#8217;s sake&mdash;and, instead of having a leading line to each row of
meshes, two are frequently blended into one. The material to be used should be
the best three-strand Italian hemp netting-line, and you must bear in mind that
the meshes at the crown should be very fine, increasing in strength as you go
downwards.</p>

<p>The last process in connection with this subject is</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">THE GAS</h4>

<p class="noindent">with which the balloon is to be inflated. It may be well for you to refer to the
chapter by Dr. Scoffern, on the apparatus and method of inflating balloons with
hydrogen gas, with his illustration of the apparatus; but as I am going more minutely
into details, I give you here the quantities of ingredients for generating sufficient
gas to fill a given-sized balloon. Thus, for instance&mdash;</p>

<p>The zinc and water are put into the generator first and corked down, and connections
made with the iron or composite pipe to the purifier, which merely contains
water (three parts full), and a small quantity of lime&mdash;say, a piece the size of a
walnut to a pint of water. Should there be any leakage round the pipe, stop it with
loam or clay. Pour the acid into the generator, through the feed-pipe, with a
funnel, in small quantities at a time. As the gas passes into the balloon you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
tell how quickly it is forming by the bubbling sound which is taking place in the
purifier. If you were to pour all the acid into the generator at once, you would
burst it. When you hear the bubbling noise diminishing, add more acid.</p>

<p>Now there is another point you must understand&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> to be able to find the
cubic capacity in feet of a balloon of a given diameter, which is done in the following
simple manner<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Diameter 2 ft. (or 24 in.). Multiply by diameter = 4. Multiply by diameter
again, = 8. Now multiply by decimal numbers &middot;5236 = 4&middot;1888.</p>

<p>The same decimal number will apply to any given diameter, and you see by this
rule that a balloon of two feet diameter will contain four cubic feet of gas, and that
the quantities of ingredients, &amp;c., required are as given above. I hope you will
excuse me for taking you to school again, but I am anxious to make this chapter as
complete as possible.</p>

<h4 class="fsize80">COST.</h4>

<p>With reference to the cost of the materials to be used in the construction of
balloons, it is obviously impossible to enter into details without knowing the size of
the balloon to be constructed. The following general instructions, however, may
be found useful.</p>

<p>Strong tissue-paper, which measures twenty by thirty inches, costs about sixpence
per quire, one quire being amply sufficient for a three-foot balloon.</p>

<p>Scotch cambric, which is forty-four inches wide, costs one shilling and twopence
per yard, and you will be able to calculate how many yards are requisite for your
purpose.</p>

<p>Boiled oil costs about fourpence per pint, half a pint being sufficient to varnish
a three-foot paper balloon.</p>

<p>Tissue-paper can be had of all colours.</p>

<p>With regard to the netting, which is technically known and must be asked for as
&#8216;netting line,&#8217; it varies in size, and costs about two shillings per lb.</p>

<p>With these few remarks I leave you to the construction of your balloon, which
I hope you will find an agreeable and not too difficult task.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXI.&mdash;SMUDGEOGRAPHY; OR, HOW TO TELL THE
CHARACTER BY HANDWRITING.</h3>

<p class="noindent">This is a portrait of Billy Baker (<a href="#FigLXI01">Fig. 1</a>). It is not by the famous Flemish artist
Van Daub, whose works are to be found in every gallery in Europe, but by his distant
relative Von Smudge, whose efforts need only to be known to be equally
appreciated. It is understood to be a successful attempt to tell Billy&#8217;s character
&#8216;from his handwriting.&#8217; It is not a flattering likeness. We are afraid Von Smudge
found that the hand was not in due submission to the will. It, however, shows
Billy as having a deal of breadth and very substantial understanding.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLXI01">

<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>It is his own fault if he did not &#8216;come out&#8217; better. All that he had to do was
to write his &#8216;usual signature&#8217; with a thickish pen dipped heavily into the ink, and
while it was wet and easily blottable Von Smudge folded the paper so as to
divide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
it in the middle, gave a little pat with his finger where the head ought to be, a
rub with his thumb where the arms should come, and an artistic flourish all along
the line, and, lo! this was the &#8216;character&#8217; he produced.</p>

<p>The parents of Billy were much flattered at the result, and, having &#8216;great faith
in the system,&#8217; proceeded to inquire whether their son would do best as a Rapparee
or a Nigger corner-man. They were informed, however, that &#8216;as the handwriting
changes the character develops,&#8217; and agreed to wait before deciding, and in the
meanwhile let Billy have six lessons from a professional writing master. This was
done, and now Billy&#8217;s writing, like Billy himself, has no character at all!</p>

<p>Martin Jones was another of Von Smudge&#8217;s sitters. He also &#8216;wrote his usual
signature,&#8217; and in like manner did &#8216;the artist&#8217; fold the paper on which it was
written and produce the accompanying Napoleonic figure (<a href="#FigLXI02">Fig. 2</a>). As Martin is a
fat-faced stunted little fellow with no chance of reaching five feet two, he decided
long ago to go in for &#8216;brain power and command,&#8217; and the Bonapartish portrait is
said by him to be &#8216;characteristic.&#8217; So it is&mdash;of Von Smudge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLXI03">

<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>Von Smudge&#8217;s theory is, that no matter what name be written, &#8216;the character
will always be that of the writer.&#8217; In an unguarded moment he consented to sign
himself as Walter Scott, and this is the &#8216;character&#8217; that was revealed (<a href="#FigLXI03">Fig. 3</a>).
There must be some truth in Von Smudge&#8217;s theory, for this is not in the least like
Sir Walter, whereas in general Janusfacedness and clumsiness it may be taken as a
fit symbol of &#8216;the artist.&#8217;</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLXI04">

<p>Miss Jenks was persuaded to have her &#8216;character indicated.&#8217; It was &#8216;indicated&#8217;
with a vengeance (<a href="#FigLXI04">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<p>She has not called again. Von Smudge says she used too fine a pen. &#8216;Freedom,
perfect freedom, is necessary in the handwriting.&#8217; To which we may add that the
thicker the lines, the more the ink, and the harder the paper, the better the result.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLXI05">
<img src="images/illo510b.jpg" alt="smudge" width="200" height="489" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 5.</p>
</div>

<p>One success Von Smudge did have, that in the case of Ellis Ferris, whom he
managed to hit off to a nicety&mdash;in a caricature, of course. We give the portrait
of Ellis in <a href="#FigLXI05">Fig. 5</a>. He is not pleased with it himself, but his friends and enemies
assure him it is &#8216;very like.&#8217; Ellis signed his name with a skewer dipped half an
inch in the inkpot, and so gave himself a chance.</p>

<p>Von Smudge has not patented his invention, so that all can try it who care to
do so. And it is not a bad amusement for a stray half-hour. The important point
is not to be too scratchy in the writing or too careful of the ink.</p>

<p>It is also capable of development. If the paper, instead of being folded in the
middle of the signature, be folded above or below it, a duplicate will be produced;
if a portrait be drawn and folded down on to the paper while the ink is wet, a reverse
copy will be printed off; and if an ornamental design be drawn on paper, it can
also be reproduced in reverse by smudgeography, and, owing to the copy taking off
the surplus ink and the original being thus reduced to about the same intensity,
the pattern will be much more equal in tone than would be thought without trial.
All sorts of outline decorative work can be done in this
way, and with careful management of the ink the labour of
drawing duplicates can be saved.</p>

<p>However, we began this chapter merely with a view of
popularising Von Smudge&#8217;s new method of character-reading,
which does not prosper in his hand quite so much as he
expected. In fact, he has taken to saying, &#8216;There is the
idea, let others try if they can make anything out of it.&#8217;
And others may as well. They will be just as near the &#8216;character&#8217;
by this means as by any other. It will take them
some time to beat the sketch of Ferris the Fierce.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXII.&mdash;THE LUDION.<br />
<span class="smcap">By the late Dr. Scoffern.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">There is a toy more patronised by French boys than by English ones, though I
have seen it here. The English name for this toy I do not know, but in France it
is called the &#8216;Ludion.&#8217; Being easily made, and instructive when made, you shall
have a picture of the ludion and instructions for making.</p>

<p>Provide yourself with a toilet water-decanter and take care that it has a good
wide mouth, the wider in fact the better. Next
purchase one of those toy porcelain figures which
girls sometimes dress up as miniature dolls, and
see that the decanter&#8217;s mouth is big enough to
admit the figure passing readily through; finally,
select a walnut, also not too big for easy entrance
into the bottle, and now you may set about making
your ludion.</p>

<p>First split the walnut into halves with a knife,
taking care you do not impart ragged edges to
the two sides of the shell, then scoop out the nut
and eat it, and having done so cement the two
half-shells together&mdash;sealing-wax will do, but shellac
is better, and marine glue (a compound of shellac
with india-rubber) is best of all. Marine glue can
be purchased of tool-makers and others, and it is
to be used exactly like sealing-wax, not dissolved in
water like ordinary glue. When the two sides of
your walnut have cooled and set, you must bore
a hole about the diameter of a pigeon&#8217;s quill at
one end.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo512.jpg" alt="Cartesian diver" width="250" height="498" />
</div>

<p>All this being done, pass a loop of fine wire
lengthwise over the walnut-shell, taking care that
the hole you have bored shall face downwards.
From the loop you see that a straight length of
wire passes downwards and is then attached to the
head of the little figure. The easiest way to effect
this attachment is by passing a small loop of the
wire round the little man&#8217;s neck.</p>

<p>The smaller the wire is you use, by so much the more invisible will it be, and
therefore the prettier. If you can get hold of a wire-covered fiddle or guitar string,
and from it strip away a suitable length of wire, nothing can be better.</p>

<p>From the neck-loop a straight length of the same wire descends, as you see
represented in the picture, and ends by attachment to what our artist has
depicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
as a leaden bullet, but a weight of any other shape would have done as well, and I
should advise you to use a piece of sheet-lead as affording easier means of attachment
than does a bullet.</p>

<p>I have said nothing yet about one little matter you will have to see to&mdash;namely,
some means of steadying and preventing from slipping the loop which passes round
the shell lengthwise. This may be effected by sealing-wax, shellac, or marine glue;
still, perhaps, better by passing a wire loop transversely round the walnut-shell, thus
covering the wire of the first loop and obliging it to lie tight to the shell without
shifting.</p>

<p>You had best now get a good large pail of water and regulate the weight of your
little man and his belongings. The success of the manufacture altogether depends
upon the care and accuracy with which this is done. Immerse the whole apparatus
and see what happens. If it sink to the bottom of the pail, your leaden weight is too
heavy, and you must cut away a portion&mdash;not too much, however, as that would
destroy the balance you want to arrive at, and which is necessary to success. No
rule other than what is called &#8216;rule of thumb&#8217; can be set down for your guidance;
but care, thought, and attention being given, you are sure to succeed at last.</p>

<p>When the proper weight has been attained, take your little man and his belongings
out of the pail, and lower all in the water-bottle about two-thirds full of water,
in which henceforth he is to dwell and perform his little gambols. Whether he can
do so or not you will soon be in a position to see. Take a piece of thin sheet india-rubber
and tie it over the decanter&#8217;s mouth, like a drumhead. If, on pressing the
drumhead with a finger, your little man descends, bobbing up again when you remove
the pressure, by this sign you shall know that the toy is complete. If otherwise,
then it is proved that your weight is not heavy enough, so out your little man must
come for emendation.</p>

<p>Now, how are you going to correct his balance? The most obvious way of doing
so would be to attach a little more weight. That device would look ugly, however,
and ugliness is to be avoided in a toy. Do you not see that putting a little water
into the nutshell through the hole would effect the purpose? But how to get the
water in is the problem; you cannot pour water in from a jug, or even a lipped
glass. It might be done by using a syringe, but a far prettier, and at the same time
more instructive device, is the one I will now show you. If you are an attentive
young fellow, taking note of whatever has been once told you, the little instrument
will come finished from your hands in ten minutes after your first setting about
making it. If you are an inattentive fellow, I do not care about having anything to
do with you. The little instrument about to be described must be made by a blow-pipe
operation. This done, you will see how to
make a good glass tool of this shape, and about
this size<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo513.png" alt="injection instrument" width="300" height="70" />
</div>

<p>Over the mouth of it you are to stretch and lap
with a piece of waxed string a thin film of sheet india-rubber. You want to get
some liquid, water in our present case, into this apparatus. Well, dip the fine-drawn
hollow spill into a vessel containing water, press the india-rubber drumhead
with finger-tip, and air bubbles will come out. Remove the pressure, and water
flows in. Removing now the immersed spill, water to any graduated amount
can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
be injected into the walnut by pressure on the drumhead&mdash;and, what is more, taken
out again if necessary. All this could be done by a syringe, but not so neatly or
conveniently.</p>

<p>By exercising the necessary amount of care in adjustment, it would be quite
possible to dispense with the leaden-weight attachment to your little man altogether.
This is sometimes done, and when done the toy is all the prettier.</p>

<p>Of course, no long explanations are needed to explain the mode of action of the
toy. Pressure on the drumhead transfers itself to the air volume inside the bottle;
the compressed air in its turn presses upon the water. Now water, unlike air, is
inelastic&mdash;it cannot be made to occupy smaller space by any force <i>you</i> could apply;
so up goes a portion of water temporarily into the walnut-shell, only to come out
again on removal of the pressure.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXIII.&mdash;MECHANICAL AND OTHER PUZZLES.</h3>

<h4>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Some Mechanical Puzzles.&mdash;By F. Chasemore.</span></h4>

<p>(1) <i>The Balance Puzzle.</i>&mdash;Cut a piece of cardboard four inches square. In
the middle punch two holes, and punch a hole also in each corner. Take four
pieces of thread eight inches long and
knot the ends together; then pass one
thread through each corner hole of the
card and fasten them there by tying a
bead to each. Now take another piece
of thread eighteen inches long and double
it in the middle, then pass the loop down
through one of the holes in the middle
of the card and up through the other
hole, and pass the loop through a small
ring. Next pass the ends of the thread
through the loop and draw it tight, and
fasten the ends to the knot joining the
four other threads (<a href="#FigLXIII01a">Fig. 1</a>). The puzzle
is to get the ring off the threads without
cutting them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLXIII01a">
<img src="images/illo515a.png" alt="puzzle" width="300" height="385" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>Take the loop and pass it down
through one of the corner holes under
the thread, and pull the bead down
through the loop. Do this to each
corner, and the loop will now be seen
to surround the whole of the threads:
pass the loop down over the cardboard,
when the ring will come off. To replace
the ring reverse the movement.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLXIII02a">
<img src="images/illo515b.jpg" alt="puzzle" width="300" height="116" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>

<p class="blankbefore">(2) <i>The Card Bridge.</i>&mdash;Take a
visiting-card and bend it as in <a href="#FigLXIII02a">Fig. 2</a>, so
that the parts bent up are half an inch
high. Now place this card on a table,
resting on the two bent parts. The
puzzle is to blow the card bridge right
over on to its back. This will not be so easy a job as it appears. The secret is
in blowing on the table about six inches in front of the bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span></p>

<p class="blankbefore">(3) <i>The Triangle Puzzle.</i>&mdash;Take six pieces of stick about three inches long,
and with them form four equilateral triangles, each triangle to have one stick for the
side. This is done by placing three sticks in a triangle on the table, and placing a
stick at each corner and letting these three sticks come together at the other ends.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLXIII03a">
<img src="images/illo516a.png" alt="puzzle" width="250" height="172" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p class="blankbefore">(4) <i>The Six Squares Puzzle.</i>&mdash;Take seventeen pieces of stick three inches
long and arrange them as in <a href="#FigLXIII03a">Fig. 3</a>. The
puzzle is, by taking away five sticks, to leave
three perfect squares, and three only, these
three squares to be three of those originally
formed, and all the same size. To do this take
the two sticks from the two top corners and
the middle stick at the bottom.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLXIII04a">
<img src="images/illo516b.jpg" alt="puzzle" width="350" height="222" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.</p>
</div>

<p class="blankbefore">(5) <i>The Puzzle Box.</i>&mdash;Take six visiting-cards
and bend them as in <a href="#FigLXIII04a">Fig. 4</a>. The puzzle
is to put them together in the form of a box,
making them fasten each other. The box will
bear rough usage. This is done by fitting the
cards together as in <a href="#FigLXIII04a">Fig. 4</a>, when they will be
found to fasten each other.</p>

<p>If you make a small hole in one of the
sides and get one of your smoking friends to fill
the box with smoke, on tapping gently the side
opposite to the hole a beautifully perfect ring
of smoke will issue from the hole, and you can
produce any number you like.</p>

<h4>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thought-guessing.</span></h4>

<p>This game is not the same played by Irving Bishop a few years ago when he
pretended to read the number of a bank-note held by a gentleman, but is quite as
easy. This game was shown me by a friend home from Penang, where it is played
a great deal, although not of foreign origin. It is played as follows:&mdash;One of the
company goes out of the room while those remaining decide on something to be
thought of; it may be something in the room or some idea suggested by something
in the room. When this is decided upon, the absentee is admitted, and he has to
guess what was thought of by asking questions, to which he only receives answer
&#8216;Yes&#8217; or &#8216;No.&#8217; He may ask any question that will help him. The first question
should be, &#8216;Is it a substance?&#8217; &#8216;No.&#8217; &#8216;Is it an abstract idea?&#8217; &#8216;Yes.&#8217; &#8216;Is the
thing that suggested the idea in the room?&#8217; &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He should first localise the
thing suggesting the idea by dividing the room by imaginary lines in all directions,
and asking first if it is on one side, and then if it is on the other, always framing the
question in such a manner that it can be answered by &#8216;Yes&#8217; or &#8216;No&#8217; as otherwise
no answer will be given. The game allows of great ingenuity in selecting the
idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
and also in working up to it in finding it out. One of the ideas I had to guess once
was this&mdash;the quantity of silex or flint in the cane of a chair on which I was sitting.
And another was this&mdash;the curve formed by the head of the hammer when giving
the last stroke to a particular nail in the wall. These look difficult, but if properly
managed will be found to be guessable. The game improves by practice, as after
two or three times you will be able to find out ideas that would at first have appeared
impossible.</p>

<h4>III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">An Improved Ring Puzzle.&mdash;By Herr Meyer.</span></h4>

<p>Among the many wire puzzles which I have seen at different times, I was pleased
with one which had two loops. I therefore added a third and subsequently a
fourth, and was successful in making the puzzle more interesting. Any boy can
easily construct the toy of iron-wire with a pair of pliers from the accompanying
<a href="#FigLXIII01b">illustration</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLXIII01b">
<img src="images/illo517.png" alt="puzzle" width="250" height="353" />
</div>

<p>The large ring is 3 inches in diameter, and the bar is 4 inches long. The object
is to remove the large ring by pushing it through the
smaller ones. The movements are explained by means
of the figures and letters written in the diagram. The
ring of the bar is called <span class="smcapall">B</span>, the ring of the first loop is 1,
that of the second loop is 2, and so on.</p>

<p>The large ring is folded by moving <span class="smcapall">D</span> upwards, so that
it falls on <span class="smcapall">C</span>. Then <span class="smcapall">A</span> is pushed from the left to the right
through 1, moved over <span class="smcapall">B</span> (that is, <span class="smcapall">B</span> is pushed through
between the two wires), and drawn back through 1.
Then the ring is folded the other way and pushed through
2 and 1, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>, back through 1, over 1 and <span class="smcapall">B</span>, and back
through 2. Then all through 3. Then through 1, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>,
back through 1; folded the other way; all through 2;
then through 1, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>, and back; and the ring is off.</p>

<p>The ring is put on thus: Fold it, push it half length
through 1, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>, back through 1; fold; all through 2;
through 1, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>, back; fold all through 3; through 2,
over <span class="smcapall">B</span> and 1, through 1, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>,
back through 1 and 2, through 1, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>, back,
and it is on.</p>

<p>When there is a fourth loop, then the ring is removed thus: Push it through 1,
over <span class="smcapall">B</span>, back, fold, through 2 and 1, over
<span class="smcapall">B</span>, back over 1 and <span class="smcapall">B</span>, back through 2,
through 3 and 2, over <span class="smcapall">B</span> and 1, through 1,
over <span class="smcapall">B</span>, back through 1 and 2, through 1,
over <span class="smcapall">B</span>, back, over 2 and 1 and
<span class="smcapall">B</span>, back through 3, all through 4, through 2, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>
and 1, through 1, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>, back through
1 and 2, through 1, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>, back, fold,
all through 3, through 1, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>, back,
fold, all through 2, through 1, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>,
back, off.</p>

<p>The ring is placed on the fourth loop thus: Fold it, push it half-way through 1,
over <span class="smcapall">B</span>, back, fold, all through 2,
through 1, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>, back, fold, all through 3, through
2, over <span class="smcapall">B</span> and 1, through 1, over
<span class="smcapall">B</span>, back through 1 and 2, through 1, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>, back,
fold, all through 4, through 3, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>
and 1, through 1, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>, back,
over 2, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
2 and 1, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>, back, over 1 and
<span class="smcapall">B</span>, back through 2 and 3, through 2, over <span class="smcapall">B</span> and 1,
through 1, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>, back through 1 and 2,
through 1, over <span class="smcapall">B</span>, back, open the ring.</p>

<p>A few very pretty experiments can be made with smoke rings, and as the apparatus
is cheap and easily procurable it may be worth while to say a few words about
them. The best arrangement for producing satisfactory results is that shown in
<a href="#FigLXIII01c">Fig. 1</a>, where a glass jar with a tap at the base is resting on a stand. Into the jar
and through the cork a small tube is fixed and the whole sealed down, so that all
air passing into the jar must come through the tube. The finer the tube the better;
the material is of no consequence&mdash;it may be of metal, glass, or clay&mdash;so long as the
passage down it is kept clear. To it, as shown in the <a href="#FigLXIII01c">cut</a>, a holder is fixed, to
which the candle or what not is attached, so that the centre of the tube points
fairly into the smoke. The jar is filled with water, the cork fixed down tightly, and
the candle lighted. The tap is then turned, and as the water runs out it sucks
down the smoke, and the rings will be seen rising through the water and forming
on its surface, as shown in <a href="#FigLXIII02c">Fig. 2</a>. These rings will soon
disappear and gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
merge into a sort of collar, shown in <a href="#FigLXIII03c">Fig. 3</a>, where the central bar is the tube
leading up to the source of smoke.</p>

<p>There are other ways of producing smoke rings. For instance, rings such as
shown in <a href="#FigLXIII04c">Fig. 4</a> are produced during the combustion of phosphuretted hydrogen,
the white vapours of the phosphoric acid rolling up into the air in apparently
whirling crowns. From guns and field-pieces the smoke often emerges in rings,
and steam out of a small vertical jet is often shot forth in small circles, such as
shown in <a href="#FigLXIII05c">Fig. 5</a>.</p>

<p>There is, however, a far simpler way of making smoke rings than any we have
described, and that is by procuring a cubical cardboard box with a small round
opening in two of its opposite faces, filling it with smoke from burning brown paper,
and sending the ring into the air by hitting the palm of the hand against one hole
so as to eject the smoke wreath at the other. In this way most excellent rings are
formed, and if received on a piece of damp glass the rings can be caught and held
for a few moments for examination. In a quiet room free from draughts the
regularity and duration of the rings will provide a surprise for those who have not
tried the experiment.</p>

<h4>V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bubble Blowing.</span></h4>

<p>We are all of us familiar with the ordinary bubble, and we have probably all had
a try with a long clay pipe and a basin of suds, and succeeded more or less,
principally less, in setting 4-inch balloons afloat over some quiet neighbourhood.
It is possible that a few of us have filled such soap balloons with hydrogen, and by
applying a light to them have caused an explosion in mid air. But how many of us
have tried to attach a car to our bubbles?</p>

<p>This can be done easily after a little practice, and the sketches herewith
make clear how to set about it. Get an ounce of glass tube from the nearest
druggist, and cut out of thin paper whatever your fancy leads you to fix to the
balloon. As something out of the ordinary lines, we give the exact size of an
a&euml;ronaut we recently despatched on a cruise (<a href="#FigLXIII01d">Fig. 1</a>).
<span class="smcapall">D</span> is a small disc of paper&mdash;proper
size; <span class="smcapall">F</span> is a fine thread&mdash;proper length below it is the paper figure, cut out
of the orange wrapper of one of the <i>Boy&#8217;s Own Paper</i> monthly parts, and it is
traced from the figure we used.</p>

<p>To make the experiment a success it is as well to remember the conditions. The
bubble rises because the air it contains is lighter than that which surrounds it; it
floats when the air is of the same temperature, it falls when the air within is colder
than the air without. The air in the bubble comes hot from the lungs, and the
greater the difference in heat between that air and the air you breathe the higher
will the bubble go. In short, to have bubbles in perfection you should blow them
in an ice room! As it is not every one that can obtain the use of a meat
storage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
safe for bubble blowing, let us make our first experiment in a cool room. Begin
with working up a good stiff lather; and the better the soap the better the suds for
our purposes. Use your tube as
you would your pipe, and blow
downwards into the basin steadily
and strongly. Take a good breath
of air to begin with, and hold it
for a second or two. Keep the
point of the tube downwards until
you have fixed on the disc in the
way shown in the sketch. No gum
or stickiness is required: all you
have to do is to let the dry disc
drop lightly on the wall of the
balloon; the moisture will keep it
in its place provided the knot of the
cotton is small enough. If you
pass the cotton through with a
needle and have the same sort of
single knot as if sewing, the disc
will answer all your requirements.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>As soon as the disc is firmly
fixed, turn the tube gently upwards,
and away will go the bubble,
a&euml;ronaut and all. It will not cross
the Atlantic, but it will at least reach the ceiling; and if on a cold day you try it
out of doors, you may get it to travel unchecked for several hundred yards.</p>

<h4>VI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Marionettes</span>,</h4>

<p class="noindent">or <i>Fantoccini</i>, are very entertaining when dexterously worked, as they may be by a
little practice. Say you have a table with drapery arranged round it to form a little
platform, and drapery also at the back. Let the latter be dark in colour, so that
the string, thread, or silk, with which you work the dolls, may be less distinguishable
if they are so at all.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLXIII01e">
<img src="images/illo522a.jpg" alt="marionette" width="350" height="465" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>The human performer (out of sight) works the figures over the back drapery,
moving every joint, and throwing balls about gaily, as in <a href="#FigLXIII01e">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p>When <i>Living Marionettes</i> are introduced&mdash;as they sometimes are at public
exhibitions&mdash;the effects are most comical. On a small stage an ordinary man&#8217;s
head is apparently attached to a miniature body, and this latter walks, dances, and
goes through many antics. The head, too, has eyes &#8216;in a fine frenzy rolling,&#8217; and is
gifted vocally, being able to talk and sing as well as many persons who fill a much
larger space in the world.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="FigLXIII02e">
<img src="images/illo522b.jpg" alt="marionette" width="350" height="297" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.</p>
</div>

<p>This is managed by having two backgrounds, one the height of the performer&#8217;s
chin, the other&mdash;a little farther back&mdash;extending to the top of the scene. Both of
these are black, and at a little distance the break in them is not
distinguishable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
The performers walk on a platform at a lower level than the stage, the doll-bodies
being fastened beneath their chins, hanging over the front drapery, and the doll&#8217;s
feet resting on the platform in view of the audience. The performers also carry
black curtains attached to them (not perceptible against the similar background),
and through these wires, fixed to the arms and legs of the manikins, are pulled to
give them motion. (See <a href="#FigLXIII02e">Fig. 2</a>.) We have
also described &#8216;<a href="#Page_388">Living Marionettes</a>&#8217; in
another part of this volume.</p>

<h4>VII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Model Wrestlers.</span></h4>

<p>A good deal of amusement can be had out of a pair of model wrestlers. The
way in which the dolls are fitted and worked is sufficiently shown in the accompanying
<a href="#FigLXIII01f">illustration</a>. The legs are in one piece, and the arms are joined so that each
doll has only four working parts. The feet are loaded to keep the figures upright
on the string, but it is not necessary that this should be done, as they can be kept
firmly on the table without. The device is a very old one. Curiously enough, in
the <i>Hortus Deliciarum</i> of Herrade de Lansberg, Abbess of Hohenburg&mdash;a manuscript
over seven hundred years old, now in the Paris Library&mdash;a man and woman
are represented playing with a couple of figures arranged very much on the same
principle, the only difference being that the dolls are separate, and worked with two
strings instead of one. The figures are knights in complete armour, with
swords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
and shields. They are hung close together, so that the swords are crossed, and the
heels are loaded to keep them upright. The strings are crossed, and held one in
each hand by the man and woman. The cross comes between the figures, so that
the string that is attached to the waist of one figure is fastened to the knee of the
other, and any motion forward is balanced by one backward, and a most realistic
encounter can be fought out almost automatically.</p>

<p>With the substitution of thin cap wire for the thread an excellent marionette or

than vertically in all cases where vigorous action is required to be simulated.</p>

</div></div>

<p>&#8216;The unstable man here commemorated was a native of Cos. I have enlarged a
little upon the description in order to introduce to you a figure which, in some
respects, resembles him. Here it is. You may easily make one like it. Get a
leaden bullet and cut it through the middle with an old knife and a hammer. Then
cut out a light figure of cork or pith, and fasten its feet to the flat part of the bullet.
Now if you try to make him lie down, you will not succeed. The moment you let
go of him he springs up again and remains in an erect position. Why is this?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;His heels are heavier than his head.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes. The man himself is so light, that nearly all the weight is in the lead;
and this being round or half-spherical, when you lay the figure down you set the
half-bullet on its edge. By so doing, you raise the centre of gravity; and it will not
rest until it has fallen again and is supported.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What is the centre of gravity?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The centre of weight; that point in a body round where all the other
parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
balance each other. It is not necessarily the centre of the figure, because one part
of a figure may be denser and heavier than another; but it is the centre of its weight.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Now take the other half of your bullet, and use it for the head of another figure.
This man will be still more eccentric than the Greek, for he will persist in standing
upon his head. His brains are evidently the heaviest part of him. The centre of
gravity is in his skull, and therefore it will seek the lowest place, and keep it
too. So you see what inconveniences a thick-brained, heavy-headed fellow is
exposed to.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He is not much worse off, though, than the light-headed Greek.&#8217;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo525.jpg" alt="unstable man" width="550" height="256" />
</div>

<p>&#8216;I suspect &AElig;lian was quizzing some one who had no force of character, and was
easily turned this way or that by anybody who would take the trouble to persuade
him: like St. James&#8217;s double-minded man, unstable in all his ways, driven by the
wind and tossed.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Whereabouts is the centre of gravity in a man?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That would be difficult to say. Somewhere in his body or trunk; for that is, of
course, the heaviest part of him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How could you find it out?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You might get near it by hanging him up in two different positions. Hang
him first by his head, and by means of a plumb-line draw a perpendicular from the
point of suspension. Then hang him by the shoulder or side, and draw another
perpendicular, which, this time, will fall across him. Where these two lines cross
each other will be the centre of gravity; and on that point you might balance him,
if you were strong enough. I dare say you have seen it done in the streets or at a
circus&mdash;a man balanced at the end of a long pole.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes. And I once saw a donkey balanced at the top of a ladder. It was a very
small donkey; but the ladder was rather a long one, and rested on the man&#8217;s chin.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The longer the ladder the easier the feat would be; I&#8217;ll tell you why presently.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If the centre of gravity is in our body or chest, how do we manage so easily to
stand upright? My sister has a wooden doll which won&#8217;t stand up at all.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8216;That doll has no muscles in her feet. You have; and even when you are
standing still those muscles are constantly at work, controlling the body so as to keep
the centre of weight directly above the feet.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t feel them working.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No; you are so used to it. But balance yourself on one foot. Do you feel the
muscles now?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes; they are constantly at work. Try it, all you boys.&#8217;</p>

<p>All the boys tried it; and very comical they looked standing in a row on one leg
and swaying about in their efforts to keep the balance. The centre of gravity was
in each case supported, though there was not much gravity in their faces. That is
not the right place for &#8216;gravity&#8217; at playtime.</p>

<p>&#8216;Steady!&#8217; cried their teacher, &#8216;you are swaying about like the unhappy Greek!
Why do you throw out your arms, first to one side and then to the other?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;To keep the balance, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;In other words, that you may bring the centre of gravity over the foot on which
you are standing. The centre of gravity moves as your arms move. If you feeling
yourself falling towards the left, you throw out your right arm, and that brings the
centre of weight more towards the right side. The centre of gravity is but a point;
and while you keep that point supported, you may stand upon a point, or upon a
rope, or upon anything else. That is how the rope-dancers manage. They usually
have a pole, weighted at each end with lead. The man and the pole form, practically,
but one body, and have but one centre of gravity; therefore, by moving the
pole a very little the performer can easily throw more weight to one side or the other
as required, and so bring the centre of gravity directly over the rope.</p>

<p>&#8216;It requires time and practice to become a good rope-dancer; more than it is
worth, perhaps. But you can make a good balancer with very little trouble.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo526.jpg" alt="bottle" width="150" height="192" />
</div>

<p>&#8216;Take a common wine-bottle; fit a short cork to it, and stick a needle through
the cork, so that the point may project upwards. That must be done before you put
the cork into the bottle; otherwise you would have to get into the
bottle to do it. The use of the bottle is merely as a stand. I wish the
bottle were never put to any worse use than that.</p>

<p>&#8216;Take another cork and stick a long pin through it, so that the
point may project half an inch or so downwards, into the sides of
this second cork stick two forks in a slanting direction, handles downwards.
Now with a little patience you will be able to place the point
of the pin upon the point of the needle; and once there, there it will
remain balanced, swaying about and perhaps turning round a little, but without
falling off. The weight is here in the forks, and the centre of gravity low down,
between the two handles. The handles, therefore, being free to move, adjust
themselves, so that the centre of gravity is supported, and that is all that is required.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Our Jack was carrying a bucket of water the other day, and the handle came
off. The bucket dropped down on one side, and he fell over on the other. What
made him fall, sir, when the bucket fell?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Jack was carrying the bucket in his left hand, I suppose, and leaning over to
the right, stretching out the right arm to keep the balance. When the weight of the
bucket was suddenly removed, the centre of gravity was raised, and thrown at
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
same time to the opposite side. As long as the heavy bucket formed part of him
(as I may say), the centre of gravity was nearer the ground; but when it fell, Jack&#8217;s
centre was raised, and he overbalanced. The lower the centre of gravity is in any
body, the more firmly that body will stand; and the higher it is up, the more likely
it will be to topple over. I saw some of you walking on the top of a wall the other
day, and you had some difficulty in balancing yourselves. Others crept on their
hands and knees; they required no balancing, because their centre of gravity was
lowered, and their base of support extended.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, I understand that. But you said just now that a man could be more
easily balanced at the top of a long pole than on a short one; or a donkey (with
four legs) upon a high ladder more easily than on a lower one. How can
that be?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It sounds like a contradiction, but it is true, nevertheless. Try it. Not with a
donkey, but with this stick, which has a heavy knob at one end. With the knob
downwards, resting on the palm of your hand, you can scarcely balance the
stick for a moment; but with the knob upwards there is comparatively little
difficulty.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is so, certainly; but I don&#8217;t understand why.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Because in this case the centre of gravity is supported by keeping the hand in
a proper position under it. When the weight is at the top of the stick, it has a
larger arc to traverse in falling from the perpendicular than if it were lower down,
and the person who balances it has a proportionately longer time to move his hand
so as to give it the necessary support. In other words, the higher the centre of
gravity is, the farther it has to fall, and the more time there is to check it while
falling.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you ever walk on stilts? If so, you will know that it is much easier to keep
the balance upon high stilts than on low ones. In some parts of France the people
are in the constant habit of walking about on stilts. The elevation enables them to
see farther across the level plains, and to observe where their flocks are feeding. If
they were to fall they would describe a large arc, and come down with great force,
but they do not fall. A very slight movement of the stilt is sufficient to keep it
under their centre of gravity. If they were lower down, greater exertion and a
swifter movement would be necessary to correct every unsteadiness. Men cannot
stand still upon stilts, because there are no muscles at the foot of the stilt to play
upon the ground and react upon the body. Observe, then, that when the base is
movable, as in balancing a ladder with a donkey on it, or in walking upon stilts, the
higher up the weight is the better. But when the base is not movable, the lower down
the centre of gravity is, the less risk there will be of an upset. Boats have often
been capsized by timid people standing up in a moment of alarm, and so raising the
centre of gravity, and coaches by having too great a load of passengers and luggage
on the roof, with no &#8220;insides.&#8221; The great thing is to keep the centre of gravity
supported, and then, though it be but a pin&#8217;s point resting upon that of a needle,
there can be no fall.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes; but one can&#8217;t always be thinking about one&#8217;s centre of gravity.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is not necessary. Habit or instinct supplies all that is wanted. You balance
yourselves from the time you get out of bed in the morning till you go to bed
again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
at night, without ever thinking about it. Only when you stand on one leg, or go
into dangerous places, are you conscious of the effort you are making. Your Maker
has ordered it thus, that you may guard against accidents, and yet be free from
constant care and trouble in doing so. Even the birds are taught to place their
heads under their wings when sleeping, so as to render their form more compact
and their balance more perfect.</p>

<p>&#8216;Walking has to be acquired in infancy, and until the foot has learnt to use its
muscles unconsciously and rightly, the child has many a fall. There are also two
ways of walking, a right and a wrong way. Some men sway from side to side as
they walk, altering the centre of gravity at every step, and being obliged to straggle
their feet accordingly to support it. A well-drilled soldier, on the contrary, keeps
his body steady, and uses his legs for the forward movement only. Of course he
gets over the ground much faster and with less exertion than the sloucher. Balancing,
like everything else, has to be learnt, and, when learnt, is practised without any
trouble. There was a man once who had been a cripple from his mother&#8217;s womb,
and who never had walked. Suddenly the use of his limbs was given him&mdash;&#8220;his feet
and ankle bones received strength.&#8221; If that had been all, it might have taken him
days or weeks to learn the right use of his muscles; he would not have been able,
without much practice, even to stand upright. But the miracle was carried beyond
this. St. Peter&#8217;s words to the cripple were, &#8220;In the name of Jesus Christ of
Nazareth, rise up <i>and walk</i>. And he leaping up stood, and entered with them into
the temple, <i>walking</i>, and <i>leaping</i>, and praising God.&#8221; Not only was strength given
him, but skill to use it; he was to &#8220;rise and walk,&#8221; and was enabled to do so at once.</p>

<p>&#8216;That completeness of cure was intended to teach what the power of the Saviour
can do for the soul in all ages, as then for the body. Our strength, and the instinct
by which we apply it, come to us gradually, and not by a miracle: but let us think
about it sometimes, and be thankful for it all the same.&#8217;</p>
